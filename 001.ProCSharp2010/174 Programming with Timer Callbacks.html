<h1>Programming with Timer Callbacks</h1>
<p>Many applications have the need to call a specific method during regular intervals of time. For example,
you may have an application that needs to display the current time on a status bar via a given helper
function. As another example, you may wish to have your application call a helper function every so
often to perform noncritical background tasks such as checking for new e-mail messages. For situations
such as these, you can use the System.Threading.Timer type in conjunction with a related delegate
named TimerCallback.</p>
<p>To illustrate, assume you have a Console Application (TimerApp) that will print the current time
every second until the user presses a key to terminate the application. The first obvious step is to write
the method that will be called by the Timer type (be sure to import System.Threading into your code file):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintTime(<span class="kwrd">object</span> state)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Time is: {0}"</span>,
            DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice how this method has a single parameter of type System.Object and returns void. This is not
optional, given that the TimerCallback delegate can only call methods that match this signature. The value
passed into the target of your TimerCallback delegate can be any bit of information whatsoever (in the
case of the e-mail example, this parameter might represent the name of the Microsoft Exchange server to
interact with during the process). Also note that given that this parameter is indeed a System.Object, you
are able to pass in multiple arguments using a System.Array or custom class/structure.</p>
<p>The next step is to configure an instance of the TimerCallback delegate and pass it into the Timer
object. In addition to configuring a TimerCallback delegate, the Timer constructor allows you to specify
the optional parameter information to pass into the delegate target (defined as a System.Object), the
interval to poll the method, and the amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) before making the first call,
for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Working with Timer type *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Create the delegate for the Timer type.</span>
    TimerCallback timeCB = <span class="kwrd">new</span> TimerCallback(PrintTime);

    <span class="rem">// Establish timer settings.</span>
    Timer t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Timer(
        timeCB, <span class="rem">// The TimerCallback delegate object.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="rem">// Any info to pass into the called method (null for no info).</span>
        0, <span class="rem">// Amount of time to wait before starting (in milliseconds).</span>
        1000); <span class="rem">// Interval of time between calls (in milliseconds).</span>

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hit key to terminate..."</span>);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>In this case, the PrintTime() method will be called roughly every second and will pass in no
additional information to said method. Here is the output:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Working with Timer type *****
Hit key to terminate...
Time is: 6:51:48 PM
Time is: 6:51:49 PM
Time is: 6:51:50 PM
Time is: 6:51:51 PM
Time is: 6:51:52 PM
Press any key to continue . . .</pre>
<p>If you did wish to send in some information for use by the delegate target, simply substitute the null
value of the second constructor parameter with the appropriate information:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Establish timer settings.</span>
Timer t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Timer(timeCB, <span class="str">"Hello From Main"</span>, 0, 1000);</pre>
<p>You can then obtain the incoming data as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintTime(<span class="kwrd">object</span> state)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Time is: {0}, Param is: {1}"</span>,
        DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString(), state.ToString());
}</pre>
