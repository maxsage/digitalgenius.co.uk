<h1>Method Group Conversion Syntax</h1>
  <p>In the previous CarDelegate example, we explicitly created instances of the Car.CarEngineHandler
delegate object in order to register and unregister with the engine notifications:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Delegates as event enablers *****\n"</span>);

    Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"SlugBug"</span>, 100, 10);
    c1.RegisterWithCarEngine(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(OnCarEngineEvent));

    Car.CarEngineHandler handler2 =
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(OnCarEngineEvent2);

    c1.RegisterWithCarEngine(handler2);
...
}</pre>
<p>To be sure, if you need to call any of the inherited members of MulticastDelegate or Delegate,
manually creating a delegate variable is the most straightforward way of doing so. However, in most
cases, you don’t really need to hang onto the delegate object. Rather, you typically only need to use the
delegate object in order to pass in the method name as a constructor parameter.</p>
<p>As a simplification, C# provides a shortcut termed method group conversion. This feature allows you
to supply a direct method name, rather than a delegate object, when calling methods that take delegates
as arguments.</p>
<p><b>Note </b>As you will see later in this chapter, you can also use method group conversion syntax to simplify how you
register with a C# event.</p>
<p>To illustrate, create a new Console Application named CarDelegateMethodGroupConversion and
insert the file containing the Car class you defined in the CarDelegate project. Now, consider the
following Program class, which uses method group conversion to register and unregister from the engine
notifications:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Method Group Conversion *****\n"</span>);
        Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();

        <span class="rem">// Register the simple method name.</span>
        c1.RegisterWithCarEngine(CallMeHere);

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Speeding up *****"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
            c1.Accelerate(20);

        <span class="rem">// Unregister the simple method name.</span>
        c1.UnRegisterWithCarEngine(CallMeHere);

        <span class="rem">// No more notifications!</span>
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
            c1.Accelerate(20);

        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CallMeHere(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; Message from Car: {0}"</span>, msg);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that we are not directly allocating the associated delegate object, but rather simply specifying
a method that matches the delegate’s expected signature (a method returning void and taking a single
string in this case). Understand that the C# compiler is still ensuring type safety. Thus, if the
CallMeHere() method did not take a string and return void, we would be issued a compiler error.</p>
