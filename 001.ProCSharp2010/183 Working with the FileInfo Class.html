<h1>Working with the FileInfo Class</h1>
<p>As shown in the previous DirectoryApp example, the FileInfo class allows you to obtain details
regarding existing files on your hard drive (e.g., time created, size, and file attributes) and aids in the
creation, copying, moving, and destruction of files. In addition to the set of functionality inherited by
FileSystemInfo, you can find some core members unique to the FileInfo class, which you can see
described in Table 20-4.</p>

<p>Note that a majority of the methods of the FileInfo class return a specific I/O-centric object (e.g.,
FileStream and StreamWriter) that allows you to begin reading and writing data to (or reading from) the
associated file in a variety of formats. You will check out these types in just a moment; however, before
you see a working example, you’ll find it helpful to examine various ways to obtain a file handle using the
FileInfo class type.</p>
<h2>The FileInfo.Create() Method</h2>
<p>One way you can create a file handle is to use the FileInfo.Create() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a new file on the C drive.</span>
    FileInfo f = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\Test.dat"</span>);
    FileStream fs = f.Create();

    <span class="rem">// Use the FileStream object...</span>

    <span class="rem">// Close down file stream.</span>
    fs.Close();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the FileInfo.Create() method returns a FileStream object, which exposes synchronous
and asynchronous write/read operations to/from the underlying file (more details in a moment). Be
aware that the FileStream object returned by FileInfo.Create() grants full read/write access to all users.</p>
<p>Also notice that after you finish with the current FileStream object, you must ensure you close down
the handle to release the underlying unmanaged stream resources. Given that FileStream implements
IDisposable, you can use the C# using scope to allow the compiler to generate the teardown logic (see
Chapter 8 for details):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Defining a 'using scope' for file I/O</span>
    <span class="rem">// types is ideal.</span>

    FileInfo f = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\Test.dat"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (FileStream fs = f.Create())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the FileStream object...</span>
    }
}</pre>
<h2>The FileInfo.Open() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the FileInfo.Open() method to open existing files, as well as to create new files with far
more precision than you can with FileInfo.Create(). This works because Open() typically takes several
parameters to qualify exactly how to iterate the file you want to manipulate. Once the call to Open()
completes, you are returned a FileStream object. Consider the following logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a new file via FileInfo.Open().</span>
    FileInfo f2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\Test2.dat"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(FileStream fs2 = f2.Open(FileMode.OpenOrCreate,
        FileAccess.ReadWrite, FileShare.None))
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the FileStream object...</span>
    }
}</pre>
<p>This version of the overloaded Open() method requires three parameters. The first parameter of the
Open() method specifies the general flavor of the I/O request (e.g., make a new file, open an existing file,
and append to a file), which you specify using the FileMode enumeration (see Table 20-5 for details):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> FileMode
{
    CreateNew,
    Create,
    Open,
    OpenOrCreate,
    Truncate,
    Append
}</pre>

        <tr>
            <td>
                CreateNew
            </td>
            <td>
                
                    Informs the OS to make a new file. If it already exists, an IOException is
thrown.
                
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Create
            </td>
            <td>
                Informs the OS to make a new file. If it already exists, it will be overwritten.
                
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Open
            </td>
            <td>
                
                    Opens an existing file. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundException is
thrown.
                
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                OpenOrCreate
            </td>
            <td>
                Opens the file if it exists; otherwise, a new file is created.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Truncate
            </td>
            <td>
                Opens an existing file and truncates the file to 0 bytes in size.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Append
            </td>
            <td>
                
                    Opens a file, moves to the end of the file, and begins write operations (you can
                    only use this flag with a write-only stream). If the file does not exist, a new
                    file
is created.
                
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<p>You use the second parameter of the Open() method, a value from the FileAccess enumeration, to
determine the read/write behavior of the underlying stream:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> FileAccess
{
    Read,
    Write,
    ReadWrite
}</pre>
<p>Finally, the third parameter of the Open() method, FileShare, specifies how to share the file among
other file handlers. Here are the core names:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> FileShare
{
    Delete,
    Inheritable,
    None,
    Read,
    ReadWrite,
    Write
}</pre>
<h2>The FileInfo.OpenRead() and FileInfo.OpenWrite() Methods</h2>
<p>The FileInfo.Open() method allows you to obtain a file handle in a flexible manner, but the FileInfo
class also provides members named OpenRead() and OpenWrite(). As you might imagine, these methods
return a properly configured read-only or write-only FileStream object, without the need to supply
various enumeration values. Like FileInfo.Create() and FileInfo.Open(), OpenRead() and OpenWrite()
return a FileStream object (note that the following code assumes you have files named Test3.dat and
Test4.dat on your C drive):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get a FileStream object with read-only permissions.</span>
    FileInfo f3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\Test3.dat"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(FileStream readOnlyStream = f3.OpenRead())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the FileStream object...</span>
    }

    <span class="rem">// Now get a FileStream object with write-only permissions.</span>
    FileInfo f4 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\Test4.dat"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(FileStream writeOnlyStream = f4.OpenWrite())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the FileStream object...</span>
    }
}</pre>
<h2>The FileInfo.OpenText() Method</h2>
<p>Another open-centric member of the FileInfo type is OpenText(). Unlike Create(), Open(), OpenRead(),
or OpenWrite(), the OpenText() method returns an instance of the StreamReader type, rather than a
FileStream type. Assuming you have a file named boot.ini on your C drive, the following snippet lets
you access to its contents:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get a StreamReader object.</span>
    FileInfo f5 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\boot.ini"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(StreamReader sreader = f5.OpenText())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the StreamReader object...</span>
    }
}</pre>
<p>As you will see shortly, the StreamReader type provides a way to read character data from the
underlying file.</p>
<h2>The FileInfo.CreateText() and FileInfo.AppendText() Methods</h2>
<p>The final two FileInfo methods of interest at this point are CreateText() and AppendText(). Both return
a StreamWriter object, as shown here:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    FileInfo f6 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\Test6.txt"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(StreamWriter swriter = f6.CreateText())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the StreamWriter object...</span>
    }

    FileInfo f7 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">@"C:\FinalTest.txt"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(StreamWriter swriterAppend = f7.AppendText())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use the StreamWriter object...</span>
    }    
}</pre>
<p>As you might guess, the StreamWriter type provides a way to write character data to the underlying
file.</p>
