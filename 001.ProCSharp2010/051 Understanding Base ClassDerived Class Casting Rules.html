<h1>Understanding Base Class/Derived Class Casting Rules</h1>
<p>Now that you can build a family of related class types, you need to learn the rules of class casting
operations. To do so, let’s return to the Employees hierarchy created earlier in this chapter. Under the
.NET platform, the ultimate base class in the system is System.Object. Therefore, everything “is-a”
Object and can be treated as such. Given this fact, it is legal to store an instance of any type within an
object variable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">void</span> CastingExamples()
{
    <span class="rem">// A Manager "is-a" System.Object, so we can</span>
    <span class="rem">// store a Manager reference in an object variable just fine.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> frank = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Frank Zappa"</span>, 9, 3000, 40000, <span class="str">"111-11-1111"</span>, 5);
}</pre>
<p>In the Employees example, Managers, SalesPerson, and PTSalesPerson types all extend Employee, so
you can store any of these objects in a valid base class reference. Therefore, the following statements are
also legal:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CastingExamples()
{
    <span class="rem">// A Manager "is-a" System.Object, so we can</span>
    <span class="rem">// store a Manager reference in an object variable just fine.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> frank = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Frank Zappa"</span>, 9, 3000, 40000, <span class="str">"111-11-1111"</span>, 5);

    <span class="rem">// A Manager "is-an" Employee too.</span>
    Employee moonUnit = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"MoonUnit Zappa"</span>, 2, 3001, 20000, <span class="str">"101-11-1321"</span>, 1);

    <span class="rem">// A PTSalesPerson "is-a" SalesPerson.</span>
    SalesPerson jill = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PTSalesPerson(<span class="str">"Jill"</span>, 834, 3002, 100000, <span class="str">"111-12-1119"</span>, 90);
}</pre>
<p>The first law of casting between class types is that when two classes are related by an “is-a”
relationship, it is always safe to store a derived object within a base class reference. Formally, this is
called an implicit cast, as “it just works” given the laws of inheritance. This leads to some powerful
programming constructs. For example, assume you have defined a new method within your current
Program class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GivePromotion(Employee emp)
{
    <span class="rem">// Increase pay...</span>
    <span class="rem">// Give new parking space in company garage...</span>
    
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} was promoted!"</span>, emp.Name);
}</pre>
<p>Because this method takes a single parameter of type Employee, you can effectively pass any
descendent from the Employee class into this method directly, given the "is-a" relationship:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CastingExamples()
{
    <span class="rem">// A Manager "is-a" System.Object, so we can</span>
    <span class="rem">// store a Manager reference in an object variable just fine.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> frank = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Frank Zappa"</span>, 9, 3000, 40000, <span class="str">"111-11-1111"</span>, 5);

    <span class="rem">// A Manager "is-an" Employee too.</span>
    Employee moonUnit = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"MoonUnit Zappa"</span>, 2, 3001, 20000, <span class="str">"101-11-1321"</span>, 1);
    GivePromotion(moonUnit);

    <span class="rem">// A PTSalesPerson "is-a" SalesPerson.</span>
    SalesPerson jill = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PTSalesPerson(<span class="str">"Jill"</span>, 834, 3002, 100000, <span class="str">"111-12-1119"</span>, 90);
    GivePromotion(jill);
}</pre>
<p>The previous code compiles given the implicit cast from the base class type (Employee) to the derived
type. However, what if you also wanted to fire Frank Zappa (currently stored in a general System.Object
reference)? If you pass the frank object directly into this method, you will find a compiler error as
follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error!</span>
<span class="kwrd">object</span> frank = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Frank Zappa"</span>, 9, 3000, 40000, <span class="str">"111-11-1111"</span>, 5);
GivePromotion(frank);</pre>
<p>The problem is that you are attempting to pass in a variable which Is-NOT-A Employee, but a more
general System.Object. Given the fact that object is higher up the inheritance chain than Employee, the
compiler will not allow for an implicit cast, in an effort to keep your code as type safe as possible.</p>
<p>Even though you can figure out that the object reference is pointing to an Employee compatible
class in memory, the compiler cannot, as that will not be known until runtime. You can satisfy the
compiler by performing an explicit cast. This is the second law of casting: you can in such cases explicitly
downcast using the C# casting operator. The basic template to follow when performing an explicit cast
looks something like the following:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">(ClassIWantToCastTo)referenceIHave</pre>
<p>Thus, to pass the object variable into the GivePromotion() method, you must author the following
code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// OK!</span>
GivePromotion((Manager)frank);</pre>
<h2>The C# as Keyword</h2>
  <p>Be very aware that explicit casting is evaluated at runtime, not compile time. Therefore, if you were to
author the following C# code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Ack! You can't cast frank to a Hexagon, but this compiles fine!</span>
Hexagon hex = (Hexagon)frank;</pre>
<p>you would compile without error, but would receive a runtime error, or more formally a runtime
exception. Chapter 7 will examine the full details of structured exception handling; however, it is worth
pointing out for the time being when you are performing an explicit cast, you can trap the possibility of
an invalid cast using the try and catch keywords (again, see Chapter 7 for full details):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Catch a possible invalid cast.</span>
<span class="kwrd">try</span>
{
    Hexagon hex = (Hexagon)frank;
}
<span class="kwrd">catch</span> (InvalidCastException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}</pre>
<p>While this is a fine example of defensive programming, C# provides the as keyword to quickly
determine at runtime whether a given type is compatible with another. When you use the as keyword,
you are able to determine compatibility by checking against a null return value. Consider the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Use 'as' to test compatability.</span>
Hexagon hex2 = frank <span class="kwrd">as</span> Hexagon;
<span class="kwrd">if</span> (hex2 == <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Sorry, frank is not a Hexagon..."</span>);</pre>
<h2>The C# is Keyword</h2>
  <p>Given that the GivePromotion() method has been designed to take any possible type derived from
Employee, one question on your mind may be how this method can determine which derived type was
sent into the method. On a related note, given that the incoming parameter is of type Employee, how can
you gain access to the specialized members of the SalesPerson and Manager types?</p>
<p>In addition to the as keyword, the C# language provides the is keyword to determine whether two
items are compatible. Unlike the as keyword, however, the is keyword returns false, rather than a null
reference, if the types are incompatible. Consider the following implementation of the GivePromotion()
method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GivePromotion(Employee emp)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} was promoted!"</span>, emp.Name);

    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (emp <span class="kwrd">is</span> SalesPerson)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} made {1} sale(s)!"</span>, emp.Name,
            ((SalesPerson)emp).SalesNumber);
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (emp <span class="kwrd">is</span> Manager)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} had {1} stock options..."</span>, emp.Name,
        ((Manager)emp).StockOptions);
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Here you are performing a runtime check to determine what the incoming base class reference is
actually pointing to in memory. Once you determine whether you received a SalesPerson or Manager
type, you are able to perform an explicit cast to gain access to the specialized members of the class. Also
notice that you are not required to wrap your casting operations within a try/catch construct, as you
know that the cast is safe if you enter either if scope, given your conditional check.</p>
