<h1>Understanding Late Binding</h1>
<p>Simply put, late binding is a technique in which you are able to create an instance of a given type and
invoke its members at runtime without having hard-coded compile-time knowledge of its existence.
When you are building an application that binds late to a type in an external assembly, you have no
reason to set a reference to the assembly; therefore, the caller’s manifest has no direct listing of the
assembly.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is not easy to see the value of late binding. It is true that if you can “bind early” to
an object (e.g., set an assembly reference and allocate the type using the C# new keyword), you should
opt to do so. For one reason, early binding allows you to determine errors at compile time, rather than at
runtime. Nevertheless, late binding does have a critical role in any extendable application you may be
building. You will have a chance to build such an “extendable” program at the end of this chapter in the
section “Building an Extendable Application”; until then, let’s examine the role of the Activator class.</p>
<h2>The System.Activator Class</h2>
<p>The System.Activator class (defined in mscorlib.dll) is the key to the .NET late binding process. For the
current example, you are only interested in the Activator.CreateInstance() method, which is used to
create an instance of a type à la late binding. This method has been overloaded numerous times to
provide a good deal of flexibility. The simplest variation of the CreateInstance() member takes a valid
Type object that describes the entity you wish to allocate into memory on the fly.</p>
<p>Create a new Console Application named LateBindingApp, and import the System.IO and
System.Reflection namespace via the C# using keyword. Now, update the Program class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This program will load an external library,</span>
<span class="rem">// and create an object using late binding.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Late Binding *****"</span>);
        <span class="rem">// Try to load a local copy of CarLibrary.</span>
        Assembly a = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">try</span>
        {
            a = Assembly.Load(<span class="str">"CarLibrary"</span>);
        }
        <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(FileNotFoundException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            <span class="kwrd">return</span>;
        }
        <span class="kwrd">if</span>(a != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
            CreateUsingLateBinding(a);

        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CreateUsingLateBinding(Assembly asm)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">try</span>
        {
            <span class="rem">// Get metadata for the Minivan type.</span>
            Type miniVan = asm.GetType(<span class="str">"CarLibrary.MiniVan"</span>);

            <span class="rem">// Create the Minivan on the fly.</span>
            <span class="kwrd">object</span> obj = Activator.CreateInstance(miniVan);
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Created a {0} using late binding!"</span>, obj);
        }
        <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, before you run this application, you will need to manually place a copy of CarLibrary.dll into
the bin\Debug folder of this new application using Windows Explorer. The reason is that you are calling
Assembly.Load(), therefore the CLR will only probe in the client folder (if you wish, you could enter a
path to the assembly using Assembly.LoadFrom(), however there is no need to do so) .</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Don’t set a reference to CarLibrary.dll using Visual Studio for this example! That will record this library in
the client’s manifest. The whole point of late binding is that you are trying to create an object which is not known
at compile time.</p>
<p>Notice that the Activator.CreateInstance() method returns a System.Object rather than a strongly
typed MiniVan. Therefore, if you apply the dot operator on the obj variable, you will fail to see any
members of the MiniVan class. At first glance, you may assume you can remedy this problem with an
explicit cast:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Cast to get access to the members of MiniVan?</span>
<span class="rem">// Nope! Compiler error!</span>
<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj = (MiniVan)Activator.CreateInstance(minivan);</pre>
<p>However, because your program has not set a reference to CarLibrary.dll, you cannot make use of
the C# using keyword to import the CarLibrary namespace, and therefore you can’t use a MiniVan during
the casting operation! Remember that the whole point of late binding is to create instances of objects for
which there is no compile-time knowledge. Given this, how can you invoke the underlying methods of
the MiniVan object stored in the System.Object reference? The answer, of course, is by using reflection.</p>
<h2>Invoking Methods with No Parameters</h2>
<p>Assume you wish to invoke the TurboBoost() method of the MiniVan. As you recall, this method will set
the state of the engine to “dead” and display an informational message box. The first step is to obtain a
MethodInfo object for the TurboBoost() method using Type.GetMethod(). From the resulting MethodInfo,
you are then able to call MiniVan.TurboBoost using Invoke(). MethodInfo.Invoke() requires you to send
in all parameters that are to be given to the method represented by MethodInfo. These parameters are
represented by an array of System.Object types (as the parameters for a given method could be any
number of various entities).</p>
<p>Given that TurboBoost() does not require any parameters, you can simply pass null (meaning “this
method has no parameters”). Update your CreateUsingLateBinding() method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CreateUsingLateBinding(Assembly asm)
{
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get metadata for the Minivan type.</span>
        Type miniVan = asm.GetType(<span class="str">"CarLibrary.MiniVan"</span>);

        <span class="rem">// Create the Minivan on the fly.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">object</span> obj = Activator.CreateInstance(miniVan);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Created a {0} using late binding!"</span>, obj);

        <span class="rem">// Get info for TurboBoost.</span>
        MethodInfo mi = miniVan.GetMethod(<span class="str">"TurboBoost"</span>);

        <span class="rem">// Invoke method ('null' for no parameters).</span>
        mi.Invoke(obj, <span class="kwrd">null</span>);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you will see the message box shown in Figure 15-2, once the TurboBoost() method is
invoked.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure15_02.png" alt="Figure 15-2" />
<p><b>Figure 15-2</b> Late-bound method invocation</p>
<h2>Invoking Methods with Parameters</h2>
<p>When you wish to use late binding to invoke a method requiring parameters, you will package up the
arguments as a loosely typed array of objects. Recall that version 2.0.0.0 of CarLibrary.dll defined the
following method in the Car class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> TurnOnRadio(<span class="kwrd">bool</span> musicOn, MusicMedia mm)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (musicOn)
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Jamming {0}"</span>, mm));
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Quiet time..."</span>);
}</pre>
<p>This method takes two parameters: a Boolean representing if the automobile’s music system should
be turned on or off, and an enum which represents the type of music player. Recall this enum was
structured as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> MusicMedia
{
    musicCd, <span class="rem">// 0</span>
    musicTape, <span class="rem">// 1</span>
    musicRadio, <span class="rem">// 2</span>
    musicMp3 <span class="rem">// 3</span>
}</pre>
<p>Here is a new method of the Program class, which invokes TurnOnRadio(). Notice that you are using
the underlying numerical values of the MusicMedia enumeration, to specify a “radio” media player.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> InvokeMethodWithArgsUsingLateBinding(Assembly asm)
{
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// First, get a metadata description of the sports car.</span>
        Type sport = asm.GetType(<span class="str">"CarLibrary.SportsCar"</span>);

        <span class="rem">// Now, create the sports car.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">object</span> obj = Activator.CreateInstance(sport);

        <span class="rem">// Invoke TurnOnRadio() with arguments.</span>
        MethodInfo mi = sport.GetMethod(<span class="str">"TurnOnRadio"</span>);
        mi.Invoke(obj, <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span>[] { <span class="kwrd">true</span>, 2 });
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Hopefully, at this point, you can see the relationships among reflection, dynamic loading, and late
binding. To be sure, the reflection API provides many additional features beyond what has been covered
here, but you should be in good shape to dig into more details if you are interested.</p>
<p>Again, you still may wonder exactly when you might make use of these techniques in your own
applications. The conclusion of this chapter should shed light on this question; however, the next topic
under investigation is the role of .NET attributes.</p>
