<h1>Understanding the Nature of Web Controls</h1>
    <p>A major benefit of ASP.NET is the ability to assemble the UI of your pages using the types defined in the
System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace. As you have seen, these controls (which go by the names server
controls, web controls, or Web Form controls) are extremely helpful in that they automatically generate
the necessary HTML for the requesting browser and expose a set of events that may be processed on the
web server. Furthermore, because each ASP.NET control has a corresponding class in the
System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace, it can be manipulated in an object-oriented manner.</p>
<p>When you configure the properties of a web control using the Visual Studio 2010 Properties window,
your edits are recorded in the opening control declaration of a given element in the *.aspx file as a series
of name/value pairs. Thus, if you add a new TextBox to the designer of a given *.aspx file and change the
ID, BorderStyle, BorderWidth, BackColor, and Text properties, the opening &lt;asp:TextBox&gt; tag is modified
accordingly (however, note that the Text value becomes the inner text of the TextBox scope):</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:TextBox</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="txtNameTextBox"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> <span class="attr">BackColor</span><span class="kwrd">="#C0FFC0"</span>
    <span class="attr">BorderStyle</span><span class="kwrd">="Dotted"</span> <span class="attr">BorderWidth</span><span class="kwrd">="3px"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Enter Your Name<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:TextBox</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>Given that the declaration of a web control eventually becomes a member variable from the
System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace (via the dynamic compilation cycle examined in Chapter 32),
you are able to interact with the members of this type within a server-side &lt;script&gt; block or the page’s
code-behind file. If you add a new Button control to an*.aspx file, you can handle the Click event and
write a server side handler that changes the background color of the TextBox:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnChangeTextBoxColor_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.EventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Change color of text box object in code.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.txtNameTextBox.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.DarkBlue;
    }
}</pre>
<p>All ASP.NET web controls ultimately derive from a common base class named
System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebControl. In turn, WebControl derives from System.Web.UI.Control
(which derives from System.Object). Control and WebControl each define a number of properties
common to all server-side controls. Before I examine the inherited functionality, let’s formalize what it
means to handle a server-side event.</p>
<h2>Understanding Server-Side Event Handling</h2>
<p>Given the current state of the World Wide Web, it is impossible to avoid the fundamental nature of
browser/web server interaction. Whenever these two entities communicate, there is always an
underlying, stateless HTTP request-and-response cycle. While ASP.NET server controls do a great deal to
shield you from the details of the raw HTTP protocol, always remember that treating the Web as an
event-driven entity is just a magnificent smoke-and-mirrors show provided by the CLR, and it is not
identical to the event-driven model of a Windows-based UI.</p>
<p>For example, although the System.Windows.Forms, System.Windows.Controls, and
System.Web.UI.WebControls namespaces define types with the same simple names (Button, TextBox,
Label, and so on), they do not expose an identical set of events. For example, there is no way to handle a
server-side MouseMove event when the user moves the cursor over a Web Form Button control. Obviously,
this is a good thing. (Who wants to post back to the server each time the user mouse moves in the
browser?)</p>
<p>The bottom line is that a given ASP.NET web control will expose a limited set of events, all of which
ultimately result in a postback to the web server. Any necessary client-side event processing will require
you to author blurbs of client-side JavaScript/VBScript script code to be processed by the requesting
browser’s scripting engine. Given that ASP.NET is primarily a server-side technology, I will not be
addressing the topic of authoring client-side scripts.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Handling an event for a given web control using Visual Studio 2010 can be done in an identical manner as
doing so for a Windows Forms control. Simply select the widget from the designer and click the lightning bolt icon
on the Properties window.</p>
<h2>The AutoPostBack Property</h2>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that many of the ASP.NET web controls support a property named
AutoPostBack (most notably, the CheckBox, RadioButton, and TextBox controls, as well as any widget that
derives from the abstract ListControl type). By default, this property is set to false, which disables an
immediate postback to the server (even if you have indeed rigged up the event in the code-behind file).
In most cases, this is the exact behavior you require, given that UI elements such as check boxes typically
don’t require postback functionality. In other words, you don’t want to post back to the server
immediately after the user checks or unchecks a checkbox, as the page object can obtain the state of the
widget within a more natural Button Click event handler.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to cause any of these widgets to post back to a server-side event handler
immediately, simply set the value of AutoPostBack to true. This technique can be helpful if you wish to
have the state of one widget automatically populate another value within another widget on the same
page. To illustrate, assume you have a web page that contains a single TextBox (named txtAutoPostback)
and a single ListBox control (named lstTextBoxData). Here is the relevant markup:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">form</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="form1"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:TextBox</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="txtAutoPostback"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:TextBox</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">br</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListBox</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="lstTextBoxData"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListBox</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">form</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Now, handle the TextChanged event of the TextBox, and within the server-side event handler,
populate the ListBox with the current value in the TextBox:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> txtAutoPostback_TextChanged(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.EventArgs e)
    {
        lstTextBoxData.Items.Add(txtAutoPostback.Text);
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you run the application as is, you will find that as you type in the TextBox, nothing happens.
Furthermore, if you type in the TextBox and tab to the next control, nothing happens. The reason is that
the AutoPostBack property of the TextBox is set to false by default. However, if you set this property to
true</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:TextBox</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="txtAutoPostback"</span>
    <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> <span class="attr">AutoPostBack</span><span class="kwrd">="true"</span> ... <span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:TextBox</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>you will find that when you tab away from the TextBox (or press the Enter key), the ListBox is
automatically populated with the current value in the TextBox. To be sure, beyond the need to populate
the items of one widget based on the value of another widget, you will typically not need to alter the state
of a widget’s AutoPostBack property (and even then, sometimes this can be accomplished purely in client
script, removing the need for server interaction at all).</p>
