<h1>Resolving Name Clashes via Explicit Interface Implementation</h1>
<p>As shown earlier in this chapter, a single class or structure can implement any number of interfaces.
Given this, there is always the possibility you may implement interfaces that contain identical members,
and therefore have a name clash to contend with. To illustrate various manners in which you can resolve
this issue, create a new Console Application named InterfaceNameClash. Now design three interfaces
that represent various locations to which an implementing type could render its output:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Draw image to a Form.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDrawToForm
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw();
}

<span class="rem">// Draw to buffer in memory.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDrawToMemory
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw();
}

<span class="rem">// Render to the printer.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDrawToPrinter
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that each interface defines a method named Draw(), with the identical signature (which
happen to be no arguments). If you now wish to support each of these interfaces on a single class type
named Octagon, the compiler would allow the following definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Octagon : IDrawToForm, IDrawToMemory, IDrawToPrinter
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Shared drawing logic.</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing the Octagon..."</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Although the code compiles cleanly, we do have a possible problem. Simply put, providing a single
implementation of the Draw() method does not allow us to take unique courses of action based on which
interface is obtained from an Octagon object. For example, the following code will invoke the same
Draw() method, regardless of which interface you obtain:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Interface Name Clashes *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="rem">// All of these invocations call the</span>
    <span class="rem">// same Draw() method!</span>
    Octagon oct = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Octagon();
    oct.Draw();

    IDrawToForm itfForm = (IDrawToForm)oct;
    itfForm.Draw();

    IDrawToPrinter itfPriner = (IDrawToPrinter)oct;
    itfPriner.Draw();

    IDrawToMemory itfMemory = (IDrawToMemory)oct;
    itfMemory.Draw();

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Clearly, the sort of code required to render the image to a window is quite different from the code
needed to render the image to a networked printer or a region of memory. When you implement several
interfaces that have identical members, you can resolve this sort of name clash using explicit interface
implementation syntax. Consider the following update to the Octagon type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Octagon : IDrawToForm, IDrawToMemory, IDrawToPrinter
{
    <span class="rem">// Explicitly bind Draw() implementations</span>
    <span class="rem">// to a given interface.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> IDrawToForm.Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing to form..."</span>);
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> IDrawToMemory.Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing to memory..."</span>);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">void</span> IDrawToPrinter.Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing to a printer..."</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, when explicitly implementing an interface member, the general pattern breaks
down to</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
returnType InterfaceName.MethodName(<span class="kwrd">params</span>)</pre>
<p>Note that when using this syntax, you do not supply an access modifier; explicitly implemented
members are automatically private. For example, the following is illegal syntax:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! No access modifer!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> IDrawToForm.Draw()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing to form..."</span>);
}</pre>
<p>Because explicitly implemented members are always implicitly private, these members are no
longer available from the object level. In fact, if you were to apply the dot operator to an Octagon type,
you would find that IntelliSense does not show you any of the Draw() members (see Figure 9-6).</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure09_06.png" alt="Figure 9-6" />
<p>As expected, you must make use of explicit casting to access the required functionality. For example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Interface Name Clashes *****\n"</span>);
    Octagon oct = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Octagon();

    <span class="rem">// We now must use casting to access the Draw()</span>
    <span class="rem">// members.</span>
    IDrawToForm itfForm = (IDrawToForm)oct;
    itfForm.Draw();

    <span class="rem">// Shorthand notation if you don't need</span>
    <span class="rem">// the interface variable for later use.</span>
    ((IDrawToPrinter)oct).Draw();

    <span class="rem">// Could also use the "as" keyword.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(oct <span class="kwrd">is</span> IDrawToMemory)
        ((IDrawToMemory)oct).Draw();

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>While this syntax is quite helpful when you need to resolve name clashes, you can use explicit
interface implementation simply to hide more “advanced” members from the object level. In this way,
when the object user applies the dot operator, he or she will see only a subset of the type’s overall
functionality. However, those who require the more advanced behaviors can extract out the desired
interface via an explicit cast.</p>
