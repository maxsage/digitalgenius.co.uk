<h1>Understanding Round-Trip Engineering</h1>
    <p>You are aware of how to use ildasm.exe to view the CIL code generated by the C# compiler (see Chapter
1). What you may not know, however, is that ildasm.exe allows you to dump the CIL contained within an
assembly loaded into ildasm.exe to an external file. Once you have the CIL code at your disposal, you are
free to edit and recompile the code base using the CIL compiler, ilasm.exe.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Also recall that reflector.exe can be used to view the CIL code of a given assembly, as well as to
translate the CIL code into an approximate C# code base.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, this technique is termed round-trip engineering, and it can be useful under a
number of circumstances:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You need to modify an assembly for which you no longer have the source code.</li>
 <li>You are working with a less-than-perfect .NET language compiler that has emitted ineffective (or flat-out 
     incorrect) CIL code, and you wish to modify the code base.</li>
 <li>You are constructing a COM interoperability assemblies and wish to account for some COM IDL attributes that 
     have been lost during the conversion process (such as the COM [helpstring] attribute).</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate the process of round-tripping, begin by creating a new C# code file (HelloProgram.cs)
using a simple text editor, and define the following class type (you are free to create a new Console
Application project using Visual Studio 2010 if you wish. However, be sure to delete the AssemblyInfo.cs
file to decrease the amount of generated CIL code):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple C# console app.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;

<span class="rem">// Note that we are not wrapping our class in a namespace,</span>
<span class="rem">// to help simplify the generated CIL code.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello CIL code!"</span>);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Save your file to a convenient location (for example, C:\RoundTrip) and compile your program using
csc.exe:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
csc HelloProgram.cs</pre>
<p>Now, open HelloProgram.exe with ildasm.exe and, using the File &gt; Dump menu option, save the
raw CIL code to a new *.il file (HelloProgram.il) in the same folder containing your compiled assembly
(all of the default values of the resulting dialog box are fine as is).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> ildasm.exe will also generate a *.res file when dumping the contents of an assembly to file. These
resource files can be ignored (and deleted) throughout this chapter, as you will not be making use of them.</p>
<p>Now you are able to view this file using your text editor of choice. Here is the (slightly reformatted
and annotated) result:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Referenced Assemblies.

{
	.publickeytoken = (B7 7A 5C 56 19 34 E0 89 )
	.ver 4:0:0:0
}

		IL_0012: ret
	}

		instance void .ctor() cil managed
	{
		.maxstack 8
		IL_0000: ldarg.0
		IL_0001: call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()
		IL_0006: ret
	}
}
</pre>
<p>First, notice that the *.il file opens by declaring each externally referenced assembly the current
assembly is compiled against. Here, you can see a single .assembly extern token set for the always
present mscorlib.dll. Of course, if your class library made use of types within other referenced
assemblies, you would find additional .assembly extern directives.</p>
<p>Next, you find the formal definition of your HelloProgram.exe assembly, which has been assigned a
default version of 0.0.0.0 (given that you did not specify a value using the [AssemblyVersion] attribute).
The assembly is further described using various CIL directives (such as .module, .imagebase, and so
forth).</p>
<p>After documenting the externally referenced assemblies and defining the current assembly, you find
a definition of the Program type. Note that the .class directive has various attributes (many of which are
actually optional) such as extends, which marks the base class of the type:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.class private auto ansi beforefieldinit Program
	extends [mscorlib]System.Object
{ ... }
</pre>
<p>The bulk of the CIL code represents the implementation of the class’s default constructor and the
Main() method, both of which are defined (in part) with the .method directive. Once the members have
been defined using the correct directives and attributes, they are implemented using various opcodes.</p>
<p>It is critical to understand that when interacting with .NET types (such as System.Console) in CIL,
you will always need to use the type’s fully qualified name. Furthermore, the type’s fully qualified name
must always be prefixed with the friendly name of the defining assembly (in square brackets). Consider
the CIL implementation of Main():</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 8
    IL_0000: nop
    IL_0001: ldstr "Hello CIL code!"
    IL_0006: call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    IL_000b: nop
    IL_000c: call string [mscorlib]System.Console::ReadLine()
    IL_0011: pop
    IL_0012: ret
}    
</pre>
<p>The implementation of the default constructor in terms of CIL code makes use of yet another “loadcentric”
instruction (ldarg.0). In this case, the value loaded onto the stack is not a custom variable
specified by you, but the current object reference (more details on this later). Also note that the default
constructor explicitly makes a call to the base class constructor, which in this case is your good friend
System.Object:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname
	instance void .ctor() cil managed
{
	.maxstack 8
	IL_0000: ldarg.0
	IL_0001: call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()
	IL_0006: ret
}
</pre>
<h2>The Role of CIL Code Labels</h2>
<p>One thing you certainly have noticed is that each line of implementation code is prefixed with a token of
the form IL_XXX: (e.g., IL_0000:, IL_0001:, and so on). These tokens are called code labels and may be
named in any manner you choose (provided they are not duplicated within the same member scope).
When you dump an assembly to file using ildasm.exe, it will automatically generate code labels that
follow an IL_XXX: naming convention. However, you may change them to reflect a more descriptive
marker:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 8
    Nothing_1: nop
    Load_String: ldstr "Hello CIL code!"
    PrintToConsole: call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    Nothing_2: nop
    WaitFor_KeyPress: call string [mscorlib]System.Console::ReadLine()
    RemoveValueFromStack: pop
    Leave_Function: ret
}</pre>
<p>The truth of the matter is that most code labels are completely optional. The only time code labels
are truly mandatory is when you are authoring CIL code that makes use of various branching or looping
constructs, as you can specify where to direct the flow of logic via these code labels. For the current
example, you can remove these autogenerated labels altogether with no ill effect:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 8
    nop
    ldstr "Hello CIL code!"
    call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    nop
    call string [mscorlib]System.Console::ReadLine()
    pop
    ret
}</pre>
<h2>Interacting with CIL: Modifying an *.il File</h2>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of how a basic CIL file is composed, let’s complete the roundtripping
experiment. The goal here is to update the CIL within the existing *.il file as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Add a reference to the System.Windows.Forms.dll assembly.</li>
 <li>Load a local string within Main().</li>
 <li>Call the System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show() method using the local string variable as an argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to add a new .assembly directive (qualified with the extern attribute) that specifies
your assembly requires the System.Windows.Forms.dll assembly. To do so, update the *.il file with the
following logic after the external reference to mscorlib:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.assembly extern System.Windows.Forms
{
    .publickeytoken = (B7 7A 5C 56 19 34 E0 89)
    .ver 4:0:0:0
}</pre>
<p>Be aware that the value assigned to the .ver directive may differ depending on which version of the
.NET platform you have installed on your development machine. Here, you see
that System.Windows.Forms.dll version 4.0.0.0 is used and has the public key token of
B77A5C561934E089. If you open the GAC (see Chapter 14) and locate your version of the
System.Windows.Forms.dll assembly, you can simply copy the correct version and public key token
value.</p>
<p>Next, you need to alter the current implementation of the Main() method. Locate this method
within the *.il file and remove the current implementation code (the .maxstack and .entrypoint
directives should remain intact):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 8
    // ToDo: Write new CIL code!
}</pre>
<p>Again, the goal here is to push a new string onto the stack and call the MessageBox.Show() method
(rather than the Console.WriteLine() method). Recall that when you specify the name of an external
type, you must make use of the type’s fully qualified name (in conjunction with the friendly name of the
assembly). Also notice that in terms of CIL, every method call documents the fully qualified return type.
Keeping these things in mind, update the Main() method as follows:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 8

    ldstr "CIL is way cool"
    call valuetype [System.Windows.Forms]
        System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult
        [System.Windows.Forms]
        System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox::Show(string)
    pop
    ret
}</pre>
<p>In effect, you have just updated the CIL code to correspond to the following C# class definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"CIL is way cool"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Compiling CIL Code Using ilasm.exe</h2>
<p>Assuming you have saved this modified *.il file, you can compile a new .NET assembly using the
ilasm.exe (CIL compiler) utility. While the CIL compiler has numerous command-line options (all of
which can be seen by specifying the -? option), Table 17-1 shows the core flags of interest.</p>
<p><b>Table 17-1.</b> Common ilasm.exe Command-Line Flags</p>

   <td>
    /output
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies the output file name and extension. If you do not make use of
the /output flag, the resulting file name (minus the file extension) is the
same as the name of the first source file.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To compile your updated HelloProgram.il file into a new .NET *.exe, you can issue the following
command within a Visual Studio 2010 command prompt:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
ilasm /exe HelloProgram.il /output=NewAssembly.exe</pre>
<p>Assuming things have worked successfully, you will see the report shown here:</p>

tripping.</p>
<h2>Authoring CIL Code Using SharpDevelop</h2>
<p>Back in Chapter 2, I made brief mention of the freely available SharpDevelop IDE
(http://www.sharpdevelop.com). Beyond supplying a number of C# and VB project templates, when you
access the File &gt; New Solution menu option, you will be happy to see one of your choices is to create a
CIL project workspace (see Figure 17-1).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure17_01.png" alt="Figure 17-1" />
<p><b>Figure 17-1</b> Figure Text</p>
<p>While SharpDevelop does not have IntelliSense support for CIL projects, CIL tokens are colorcoded,
and you are able to compile and run your application directly within the IDE (rather than
running ilasm.exe from a command prompt). When you create this project type, you will be given an
initial *.il file looking like so (Figure 17-2).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure17_02.png" alt="Figure 17-2" />
<p><b>Figure 17-2</b> Figure Text</p>
<p>As you work through the remaining examples of this chapter, I’d recommend using SharpDevelop to
author the CIL code. Beyond some color coding functionality, the CIL project workspace will also help
you quickly locate the position of coding typos via the Errors window.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The MonoDevelop IDE, a free IDE for building .NET applications under the Mono platform, also supports a
CIL project template. See Appendix B for details about MonoDevelop</p>
<h2>The Role of peverify.exe2</h2>
<p>When you are building or modifying assemblies using CIL code, it is always advisable to verify that the
compiled binary image is a well-formed .NET image using the peverify.exe command-line tool:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
peverify NewAssembly.exe</pre>
<p>This tool will examine all opcodes within the specified assembly for valid CIL code. For example, in
terms of CIL code, the evaluation stack must always be empty before exiting a function. If you forget to
pop off any remaining values, the ilasm.exe compiler will still generate a compiled assembly (given that
compilers are concerned only with syntax). peverify.exe, on the other hand, is concerned with
semantics. If you did forget to clear the stack before exiting a given function, peverify.exe will let you
know before you try running your code base.</p>
