    <h1>
        Building C# Applications Using csc.exe</h1>
    <p>
        While it is true that you may never decide to build a large-scale application using
        nothing but the C# command-line compiler, it is important to understand the basics
        of how to compile your code files by hand. I can think of a few reasons you should
        get a grip on the process.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The most obvious reason is the simple fact that you might not have a copy of Visual
                Studio 2010 or another graphical IDE.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                You may be in a university setting where you are prohibited from using code generation
                tools/IDEs in the classroom.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                You plan to make use of automated build tools, such as msbuild.exe which require
                you to know the command-line options of the tools you are utilizing.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                You want to deepen your understanding of C#. When you use graphical IDEs to build
                applications, you are ultimately instructing csc.exe how to manipulate your C# input
                files. In this light, it's edifying to see what takes place behind the scenes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Another nice by-product of working with csc.exe in the raw is that you become that
        much more comfortable manipulating other command-line tools included with the .NET
        Framework 4.0 SDK. A number of important utilities are accessible only from the
        command line.
    </p>
    <p>
        To illustrate how to build a .NET application IDE-free, we will build a simple executable
        assembly named TestApp.exe using the C# command-line compiler and Notepad. First,
        you need some source code. Open Notepad (using the Start ? All Programs ? Accessories
        menu option) and enter the following trivial C# class definition:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple C# application.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;

<span class="kwrd">class</span> TestApp
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
    {
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Testing! 1, 2, 3"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Once you have finished, save the file in a convenient location (e.g., C:\CscExample) as TestApp.cs.
    Now let's get to know the core options of the C# compiler.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> As a convention, all C# code files take a *.cs file extension. The name of the file does not need to have
    any mapping to the name of the type (or types) it is defining.</p>
    <h2>Specifying Input and Output Targets</h2>
    <p>The first point of interest is to understand how to specify the name and type of assembly to create (e.g., a
    console application named MyShell.exe, a code library named MathLib.dll, a Windows Presentation
    Foundation application named Halo8.exe). Each possibility is represented by a specific flag passed into
    csc.exe as a command-line parameter (see Table 2-1).</p>
    <p><b>Table 2-1.</b> Output Options of the C# Compiler</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>Option</th>
            <th>Meaning in Life</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/out</td>
            <td>This option is used to specify the name of the assembly to be created. By
            default, the assembly name is the same as the name of the initial input *.cs
            file.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/target:exe</td>
            <td>This option builds an executable console application. This is the default
            assembly output type, and thus may be omitted when building this type of
            application.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/target:library</td>
            <td>This option builds a single-file *.dll assembly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/target:module</td>
            <td>This option builds a module. Modules are elements of multi-file assemblies
            (fully described in Chapter 14).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>/target:winexe</td>
            <td>Although you are free to build graphical user interface-based applications
        using the /target:exe option, /target:winexe prevents a console window
        from appearing in the background.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><b>Note </b>The options sent to the command-line compiler (as well as most other command-line tools) can be
    prefixed with either a dash (-) or a slash (/).</p>
    <p>To compile TestApp.cs into a console application named TestApp.exe, change to the directory
    containing your source code file</p>
    <p>cd C:\CscExample</p>
    <p>and enter the following command set (note that command-line flags must come before the name of the
    input files, not after):</p>
    <p>csc /target:exe TestApp.cs</p>
    <p>Here I did not explicitly specify an /out flag; therefore, the executable will be named TestApp.exe
    given that TestApp is the name of the input file. Also be aware that most of the C# compiler flags support
    an abbreviated version, such as /t rather than /target (you can view all abbreviations by entering csc -?
    at the command prompt).</p>
    <p>csc /t:exe TestApp.cs</p>
    <p>Furthermore, given that the /t:exe flag is the default output used by the C# compiler, you could also
    compile TestApp.cs simply by typing the following:
    csc TestApp.cs</p>
    <p>TestApp.exe can now be run from the command line by typing the name of the executable, as shown
    in Figure 2-2.</p>

    <h2>Referencing External Assemblies</h2>
    <p>Next, let's examine how to compile an application that makes use of types defined in a separate .NET
    assembly. And just in case you are wondering how the C# compiler understood your reference to the
    System.Console type, recall from Chapter 1 that mscorlib.dll is automatically referenced during the
    compilation process (if for some strange reason you wish to disable this feature, you may specify the
    /nostdlib option of csc.exe).</p>
    <p>Let's update the TestApp application to display a Windows Forms message box. Open your
    TestApp.cs file and modify it as follows:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
    
<span class="rem">// Add this!</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Windows.Forms;

<span class="kwrd">class</span> TestApp
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
    {
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Testing! 1, 2, 3"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Add this!</span>
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Hello..."</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice you are importing the System.Windows.Forms namespace via the C# using keyword
    (introduced in Chapter 1). Recall that when you explicitly list the namespaces used within a given *.cs
    file, you avoid the need to make use of fully qualified names of a type (which can lead to hand cramps).</p>
    <p>At the command line, you must inform csc.exe which assembly contains the namespaces you are
    using. Given that you have made use of the System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox class, you must specify
    the System.Windows.Forms.dll assembly using the /reference flag (which can be abbreviated to /r).</p>
    <p>csc /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll TestApp.cs</p>
    <p>If you now rerun your application, you should see a message box appear (see Figure 2-3) in addition
    to the console output.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure02_03.png" alt="Figure 2-3" />
    <p><b>Figure 2-3.</b> Your first Windows Forms application</p>
    <h2>Referencing Multiple External Assemblies</h2>
    <p>On a related note, what if you need to reference numerous external assemblies using csc.exe? Simply list
    each assembly using a semicolon-delimited list. You don't need to specify multiple external assemblies
    for the current example, but some sample usage follows:</p>
    <p>csc /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll;System.Drawing.dll *.cs</p>
    <p><b>Note </b>As explained a bit later in this chapter, the C# compiler will automatically reference a set of core .NET
    assemblies (such as System.Windows.Forms.dll) even if they are not specified using the /r flag.</p>
    <h2>Compiling Multiple Source Files</h2>
    <p>The current incarnation of the TestApp.exe application was created using a single *.cs source code file.
    While it is perfectly permissible to have all of your .NET types defined in a single *.cs file, most projects
    are composed of multiple *.cs files to keep your code base a bit more flexible. Assume you have
    authored a new class contained in a new file named HelloMsg.cs.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The HelloMessage class</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Windows.Forms;

<span class="kwrd">class</span> HelloMessage
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Speak()
    {
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Hello..."</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Now, update your initial TestApp class to make use of this new class type and comment out the
    previous Windows Forms logic.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
    
<span class="rem">// Don't need this anymore.</span>
<span class="rem">// using System.Windows.Forms;</span>
    
<span class="kwrd">class</span> TestApp
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Testing! 1, 2, 3"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Don't need this anymore either.</span>
        <span class="rem">// MessageBox.Show("Hello...");</span>
    
    <span class="rem">// Use the HelloMessage class!</span>
    HelloMessage h = <span class="kwrd">new</span> HelloMessage();
        h.Speak();
    }
}
</pre>
    <p>You can compile your C# files by listing each input file explicitly.</p>
    <p>csc /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll TestApp.cs HelloMsg.cs</p>
    <p>As an alternative, the C# compiler allows you to make use of the wildcard character (*) to inform
    csc.exe to include all *.cs files contained in the project directory as part of the current build.</p>
    <p>csc /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll *.cs</p>
    <p>When you run the program again, the output is identical to the previous compiled code. The only
    difference between the two applications is the fact that the current logic has been split among multiple
    files.</p>
    <h2>Working with C# Response Files</h2>
    <p>As you might guess, if you were to build a complex C# application at the command prompt, you would
    have to specify a tedious number of input options to inform the compiler how to process your source
    code. To help lessen your typing burden, the C# compiler honors the use of response files.</p>
    <p>C# response files contain all the instructions to be used during the compilation of your current
    build. By convention, these files end in a *.rsp (response) extension. Assume that you have created a
    response file named TestApp.rsp that contains the following options (as you can see, comments are
    denoted with the # character):</p>
    <pre># This is the response file
    # for the TestApp.exe example
    # of Chapter 2.

    # External assembly references.
    /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll

    # output and files to compile (using wildcard syntax).
    /target:exe /out:TestApp.exe *.cs</pre>
    <p>Now, assuming this file is saved in the same directory as the C# source code files to be compiled,
    you are able to build your entire application as follows (note the use of the @ symbol):</p>
    <p>csc @TestApp.rsp</p>
    <p>If the need should arise, you can also specify multiple *.rsp files as input (e.g., csc @FirstFile.rsp
    @SecondFile.rsp @ThirdFile.rsp). If you take this approach, be aware that the compiler processes the
    command options as they are encountered. Therefore, command-line arguments in a later *.rsp file can
    override options in a previous response file.</p>
    <p>Also note that flags listed explicitly on the command line before a response file will be overridden by
    the specified *.rsp file. Thus, if you were to enter the following:</p>
    <p>csc /out:MyCoolApp.exe @TestApp.rsp</p>
    <p>the name of the assembly would still be TestApp.exe (rather than MyCoolApp.exe), given the
    /out:TestApp.exe flag listed in the TestApp.rsp response file. However, if you list flags after a response
    file, the flag will override settings in the response file.</p>
    <p><b>Note </b>The effect of the /reference flag is cumulative. Regardless of where you specify external assemblies
    (before, after, or within a response file), the end result is a summation of each reference assembly.</p>
    <h2>The Default Response File (csc.rsp)</h2>
    <p>The final point to be made regarding response files is that the C# compiler has an associated default
    response file (csc.rsp), which is located in the same directory as csc.exe itself (which is by default
    installed under C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\&lt;version&gt;, where &lt;version&gt; is a given version of
    the platform). If you were to open this file using Notepad, you will find that numerous .NET assemblies
    have already been specified using the /r: flag, including various libraries for web development, LINQ
    programming, data access, and other core libraries (beyond mscorlib.dll).</p>
    <p>When you are building your C# programs using csc.exe, this response file will be automatically
    referenced, even when you supply a custom *.rsp file. Given the presence of the default response file,
    the current TestApp.exe application could be successfully compiled using the following command set (as
    System.Windows.Forms.dll is referenced within csc.rsp):</p>
    <p>csc /out:TestApp.exe *.cs</p>
    <p>In the event that you wish to disable the automatic reading of csc.rsp, you can specify the /noconfig
    option.</p>
    <p>csc @TestApp.rsp /noconfig</p>
    <p><b>Note </b>If you reference assemblies (via the /r option) that you do not actually make use of, they are ignored by
    the compiler. Therefore, you have no need to worry about 'code bloat.'</p>
    <p>Obviously, the C# command-line compiler has many other options that can be used to control how
    the resulting .NET assembly is to be generated. You'll see other important features where necessary over
    the course of this text, however full details of these options can be found within the .NET Framework 4.0
    SDK documentation.</p>
