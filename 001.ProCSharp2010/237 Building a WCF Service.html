<h1>Building a WCF Service</h1>
   <p>Now that you have a better understanding about the building blocks of a WCF application, it’s time to
create your first sample application and see how the ABCs are accounted for in code and configuration.
This first example avoids using the Visual Studio 2010 WCF project templates, so you can focus on the
specific steps involved in making a WCF service.</p>
<p>Begin by creating a new C# Class Library project named MagicEightBallServiceLib. Next, rename
your initial file from Class1.cs to MagicEightBallService.cs, and then add a reference to the
System.ServiceModel.dll assembly. In the initial code file, specify that you are using the
System.ServiceModel namespace. At this point, your C# file should look like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="rem">// The key WCF namespace.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.ServiceModel;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MagicEightBallServiceLib
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MagicEightBallService
    {
    }
}</pre>
<p>Your class type implements a single WCF service contract represented by a strongly typed CLR
interface named IEightBall. As you most likely know, the Magic 8-Ball is a toy that allows you to view
one of a handful of fixed answers to a question you might ask. Your interface here will define a single
method that allows the caller to pose a question to the Magic 8-Ball to obtain a random answer.</p>
<p>WCF service interfaces are adorned with the [ServiceContract] attribute, while each interface
member is decorated with the [OperationContract] attribute (you’ll learn more details regarding these
two attributes in just a moment). Here is the definition of the IEightBall interface:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[ServiceContract]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IEightBall
{
    <span class="rem">// Ask a question, receive an answer!</span>
    [OperationContract]
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> ObtainAnswerToQuestion(<span class="kwrd">string</span> userQuestion);
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> It is permissible to define a service contract interface that contains methods not adorned with the
[OperationContract] attribute; however, such members will not be exposed through the WCF runtime.</p>
<p>As you know from your study of the interface type (see Chapter 9), interfaces are quite useless until
they are implemented by a class or structure that fleshes out their functionality. Like a real Magic 8-Ball,
the implementation of your service type (MagicEightBallService) will randomly return a canned answer
from an array of strings. Also, your default constructor will display an information message that will be
(eventually) displayed within the host’s console window (for diagnostic purposes):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MagicEightBallService : IEightBall
{
    <span class="rem">// Just for display purposes on the host.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MagicEightBallService()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The 8-Ball awaits your question..."</span>);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ObtainAnswerToQuestion(<span class="kwrd">string</span> userQuestion)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] answers = { <span class="str">"Future Uncertain"</span>, <span class="str">"Yes"</span>, <span class="str">"No"</span>,
            <span class="str">"Hazy"</span>, <span class="str">"Ask again later"</span>, <span class="str">"Definitely"</span> };

        <span class="rem">// Return a random response.</span>
        Random r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Random();
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> answers[r.Next(answers.Length)];
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, your WCF service library is complete. However, before you construct a host for this
service, you need to examine some additional details of the [ServiceContract] and [OperationContract]
attributes.</p>
<h2>The [ServiceContract] Attribute</h2>
<p>For a CLR interface to participate in the services provided by WCF, it must be adorned with the
[ServiceContract] attribute. Like many other .NET attributes, the ServiceContractAttribute type
supports many properties that further qualify its intended purpose. You can set two properties, Name and
Namespace, to control the name of the service type and the name of the XML namespace that defines the
service type. If you use a web service–specific binding, you use these values to define the &lt;portType&gt;
elements of the related WSDL document.</p>
<p>Here, you do not bother to assign a Name value because the default name of the service type is
directly based on the C# class name. However, the default name for the underlying XML namespace is
simply http://tempuri.org (you should change this for all of your WCF services).</p>
<p>When you build a WCF service that will send and receive custom data types (which you are not
currently doing), it is important that you establish a meaningful value to the underlying XML namespace
because this ensures that your custom types are unique. As you might know from your experience
building XML web services, XML namespaces provide a way to wrap your custom types in a unique
container to ensure that your types do not clash with types in another organization.</p>
<p>For this reason, you can update your interface definition with a more fitting definition, which, much
like the process of defining an XML namespace in a .NET Web Service project, is typically the URI of the
service’s point of origin, as in the following example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[ServiceContract(Namespace = <span class="str">"http://MyCompany.com"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IEightBall
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>Beyond Namespace and Name, the [ServiceContract] attribute can be configured with the additional
properties shown in Table 25-6. Be aware that some of these settings will be ignored, depending on your
binding selection.</p>
<p><b>Table 25-6.</b> Various Named Properties of the [ServiceContract] Attribute</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Property
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    CallbackContract
   </td>
   <td>
    Establishes whether this service contract requires callback functionality for
two-way message exchange (e.g., duplex bindings).
   </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
   <td>
    ConfigurationName
   </td>
   <td>
    You use this name to locate the service element in an application
configuration file. The default is the name of the service implementation
class.
   </td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
   <td>
    ProtectionLevel
   </td>
   <td>
    Allows you to specify the degree to which the contract binding requires
encryption, digital signatures, or both for endpoints that expose the
contract.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    SessionMode
   </td>
   <td>
    You use this to establish whether sessions are allowed, not allowed, or
required by this service contract.
   </td>
  </tr>  
</table>
<h2>The [OperationContract] Attribute</h2>
<p>Methods that you wish to use within the WCF framework must be attributed with the
[OperationContract] attribute, which can also be configured with various named properties. You can
use the properties shown in Table 25-7 to declare that a given method is intended to be one-way in
nature, supports asynchronous invocation, requires encrypted message data, and so forth (again, many
of these values might be ignored based on your binding selection).</p>
<p><b>Table 25-7.</b> Various Named Properties of the [OperationContract] Attribute</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Property
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AsyncPattern
   </td>
   <td>
    Indicates whether the operation is implemented asynchronously using a
Begin/End method pair on the service. This allows the service to offload
processing to another server-side thread; this has nothing to do with the client
calling the method asynchronously!
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsInitiating
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies whether this operation can be the initial operation in a session.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsOneWay
   </td>
   <td>
    Indicates whether the operation consists of only a single input message (and no
associated output).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsTerminating
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies whether the WCF runtime should attempt to terminate the current
session after the operation completes.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For the initial example, you don’t need to configure the ObtainAnswerToQuestion() method with
additional traits; this means you can use the [OperationContract] attribute as currently defined.</p>
<h2>Service Types As Operational Contracts</h2>
<p>Finally, recall that the use of interfaces is not required when building WCF service types. In fact, it is
possible to apply the [ServiceContract] and [OperationContract] attributes directly to the service type
itself:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This is only for illustrative purposes</span>
<span class="rem">// and not used for the current example.</span>
[ServiceContract(Namespace = <span class="str">"http://MyCompany.com"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ServiceTypeAsContract
{    
    [OperationContract]
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> SomeMethod() { }

    [OperationContract]
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> AnotherMethod() { }
}</pre>
<p>You can take this approach; however, you receive many benefits if you explicitly define an interface
type to represent the service contract. The most obvious benefit is that you can apply a given interface to
multiple service types (authored in a variety of languages and architectures) to achieve a high degree of
polymorphism. Another benefit: You can use a service contract interface as the basis of new contracts
(using interface inheritance), without having to carry any implementation baggage.</p>
<p>In any case, your first WCF service library is now complete. Compile your project to ensure you do
not have any typos.</p>
