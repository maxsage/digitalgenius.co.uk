    <h1>The System.Console Class</h1>
     <p>Almost all of the example applications created over the course of the initial chapters of this book make
    extensive use of the System.Console class. While it is true that a console user interface (CUI) is not as
    enticing as a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-application, restricting the early examples to console
    programs will allow us to keep focused on the syntax of C# and the core aspects of the .NET platform,
    rather than dealing with the complexities of building GUIs or web sites.</p>
    <p>As its name implies, the Console class encapsulates input, output, and error-stream manipulations
    for console-based applications. Table 3-2 lists some (but definitely not all) members of interest.</p>
    <p><b>Table 3-2.</b> Select Members of System.Console</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>Member</th>
            <th>Meaning in Life</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Beep()</td>
            <td>This method forces the console to emit a beep of a specified frequency
            and duration.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>BackgroundColor ForegroundColor</td>
            <td>These properties set the background/foreground colors for the current
            output. They may be assigned any member of the ConsoleColor
            enumeration.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>BufferHeight BufferWidth</td>
            <td>These properties control the height/width of the console's buffer area.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Title</td>
            <td>This property sets the title of the current console.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>WindowHeight WindowWidth WindowTop WindowLeft</td>
            <td>These properties control the dimensions of the console in relation to the
            established buffer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Clear()</td>
            <td>This method clears the established buffer and console display area.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
     <h2>Basic Input and Output with the Console Class</h2>
     <p>In addition to the members in Table 3-2, the Console type defines a set of methods to capture input and
    output, all of which are static and are therefore called by prefixing the name of the class (Console) to the
    method name. As you have seen, WriteLine() pumps a text string (including a carriage return) to the
    output stream. The Write() method pumps text to the output stream without a carriage return.
    ReadLine() allows you to receive information from the input stream up until the Enter key is pressed,
    while Read() is used to capture a single character from the input stream.</p>
     <p>To illustrate basic I/O using the Console class, create a new Console Application project named
    BasicConsoleIO and update your Main() method to call a helper method named GetUserData():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Basic Console I/O *****"</span>);
        GetUserData();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Implement this method within the Program class with logic that prompts the user for some bits of
    information and echoes each item to the standard output stream. For example, we could ask the user for
    his or her name and age (which we will treat as a text value for simplicity, rather than the expected
    numerical value) as follows:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GetUserData()
{
    <span class="rem">// Get name and age.</span>
    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Please enter your name: "</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> userName = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Please enter your age: "</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> userAge = Console.ReadLine();

    <span class="rem">// Change echo color, just for fun.</span>
    ConsoleColor prevColor = Console.ForegroundColor;
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;

    <span class="rem">// Echo to the console.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello {0}! You are {1} years old."</span>,
        userName, userAge);

    <span class="rem">// Restore previous color.</span>
    Console.ForegroundColor = prevColor;
}</pre>
    <p>Not surprisingly, when you run this application, the input data is printed to the console (using a
    custom color to boot!).</p>
     <h2>Formatting Console Output</h2>
     <p>During these first few chapters, you may have noticed numerous occurrences of tokens such as {0} and
    {1} embedded within various string literals. The .NET platform support a style of string formatting
    slightly akin to the printf() statement of C. Simply put, when you are defining a string literal that
    contains segments of data whose value is not known until runtime, you are able to specify a placeholder
    within the literal using this curly-bracket syntax. At runtime, the value(s) passed into
    Console.WriteLine() are substituted for each placeholder.</p>
    <p>The first parameter to WriteLine() represents a string literal that contains optional place-holders
    designated by {0}, {1}, {2}, and so forth. Be very aware that the first ordinal number of a curly-bracket
    placeholder always begins with 0. The remaining parameters to WriteLine() are simply the values to be
    inserted into the respective placeholders.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> If you have more uniquely numbered curly-bracket placeholders than fill arguments, you will receive a
    format exception at runtime.</p>
    <p>It is also permissible for a given placeholder to repeat within a given string. For example, if you are a
    Beatles fan and want to build the string "9, Number 9, Number 9", you would write:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// John says...</span>
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0}, Number {0}, Number {0}"</span>, 9);</pre>
    <p>Also know that it is possible to position each placeholder in any location within a string literal, and it
    need not follow an increasing sequence. For example, consider the following code snippet:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Prints: 20, 10, 30</span>
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{1}, {0}, {2}"</span>, 10, 20, 30);</pre>
    <h2>Formatting Numerical Data</h2>
    <p>If you require more elaborate formatting for numerical data, each placeholder can optionally contain
    various format characters. Table 3-3 shows the most common formatting options.</p>
    <p><b>Table 3-3.</b> .NET Numerical Format Characters</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>String Format Character</th>
            <th>Meaning in Life</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C or c</td>
            <td>Used to format currency. By default, the flag will prefix the local cultural
            symbol (a dollar sign [$] for U.S. English).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D or d</td>
            <td>Used to format decimal numbers. This flag may also specify the
            minimum number of digits used to pad the value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>E or e</td>
            <td>Used for exponential notation. Casing controls whether the exponential
            constant is uppercase (E) or lowercase (e).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>F or f</td>
            <td>Used for fixed-point formatting. This flag may also specify the minimum
            number of digits used to pad the value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>G or g</td>
            <td>Stands for general. This character can be used to format a number to fixed
            or exponential format.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>N or n</td>
            <td>Used for basic numerical formatting (with commas).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X or x</td>
            <td>Used for hexadecimal formatting. If you use an uppercase X, your hex
            format will also contain uppercase characters.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>These format characters are suffixed to a given placeholder value using the colon token (e.g., {0:C},
    {1:d}, {2:X}). To illustrate, update the Main() method to call a new helper function named
    FormatNumericalData(). Implement this method in your Program class to format a fixed numerical value
    in a variety of ways.</p>

    <p>Beyond controlling how numerical data is formatted, the .NET platform provides additional tokens
    that may appear in a string literal that controls spacing and positioning of content. Furthermore, the
    tokens applied to numerical data can be applied to other data types (such as enumerations or the
    DateTime type) to control data formatting. Also, be aware that it is possible to build a custom class (or
    structure) that defines a custom formatting scheme through the implementation of the
    ICustomFormatter interface.</p>
    <p>You'll see additional formatting examples where required throughout this text; however, if you are
    interested in digging into .NET string formatting further, look up formatting types within the .NET
    Framework 4.0 SDK documentation.</p>
    <h2>Formatting Numerical Data Beyond Console Applications</h2>
    <p>On a final note, be aware that the use of the .NET string formatting characters is not limited to console
    programs. This same formatting syntax can be used when calling the static string.Format() method.
    This can be helpful when you need to compose textual data at runtime for use in any application type
    (e.g., desktop GUI app, ASP.NET web app, XML web services).</p>
    <p>For example, assume you are building a graphical Windows Forms desktop application and need to
    format a string for display in a message box.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayMessage()
{
    <span class="rem">// Using string.Format() to format a string literal.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> userMessage = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"100000 in hex is {0:x}"</span>,
        100000);

    <span class="rem">// You would need to reference System.Windows.Forms.dll</span>
    <span class="rem">// in order to compile this line of code!</span>
    System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show(userMessage);
}</pre>
    <p>Notice how string.Format() returns a new string object, which is formatted according to the
    provided flags. After this point, you are free to use the textual data as you see fit.</p>
