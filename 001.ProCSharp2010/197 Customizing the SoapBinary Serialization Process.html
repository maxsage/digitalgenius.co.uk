<h1>Customizing the Soap/Binary Serialization Process</h1>
<p>In a majority of cases, the default serialization scheme provided by the .NET platform will be exactly
what you require. Simply apply the [Serializable] attribute to your related types and pass the tree of
objects to your formatter of choice for processing. In some cases, however, you might wish to become
more involved with how a tree is constructed and handled during the serialization process. For example,
perhaps you have a business rule that says all field data must be persisted using a particular format, or
perhaps you wish to add additional bits of data to the stream that do not map directly to fields in the
object being persisted (e.g., timestamps and unique identifiers).</p>
<p>When you wish to become more involved with the process of object serialization, the
System.Runtime.Serialization namespace provides several types that allow you to do so. Table 20-13
describes some of the core types you should be aware of.</p>

<h2>A Deeper Look at Object Serialization</h2>
<p>Before you examine various ways that you can customize the serialization process, you will find it
helpful to take a deeper look at what takes place behind the scenes. When the BinaryFormatter serializes
an object graph, it is in charge of transmitting the following information into the specified stream:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The fully qualified name of the objects in the graph (e.g., MyApp.JamesBondCar)</li>
 <li>The name of the assembly defining the object graph (e.g., MyApp.exe)</li>
 <li>An instance of the SerializationInfo class that contains all stateful data
maintained by the members in the object graph</li>
</ul>
<p>During the deserialization process, the BinaryFormatter uses this same information to build an
identical copy of the object, using the information extracted from the underlying stream. SoapFormatter
uses a quite similar process.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Recall that the XmlSerializer does not persist a type’s fully qualified name or the name of the defining
assembly; this behavior helps keep the state of the object as mobile as possible. This type is concerned only with
persisting exposed public data.</p>
<p>Beyond moving the required data into and out of a stream, formatters also analyze the members in
the object graph for the following pieces of infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A check is made to determine whether the object is marked with the
[Serializable] attribute. If the object is not, a SerializationException is thrown.</li>
 <li>If the object is marked [Serializable], a check is made to determine whether the
object implements the ISerializable interface. If this is the case, GetObjectData()
is called on the object.</li>
 <li>If the object does not implement ISerializable, the default serialization process
is used, serializing all fields not marked as [NonSerialized].</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to determining whether the type supports ISerializable, formatters are also
responsible for discovering whether the types in question support members that have been adorned
with the [OnSerializing], [OnSerialized], [OnDeserializing], or [OnDeserialized] attributes. You’ll
examine the role of these attributes in mometarily, but first you need to look at the role of ISerializable.</p>
<h2>Customizing Serialization Using ISerializable</h2>
<p>Objects that are marked [Serializable] have the option of implementing the ISerializable interface.
Doing so lets you get “involved” with the serialization process and perform any pre- or post-data
formatting.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Since the release of .NET 2.0, the preferred way to customize the serialization process is to use the
serialization attributes (described next). However, knowledge of ISerializable is important for the purpose of
maintaining existing systems.</p>
<p>The ISerializable interface is quite simple, given that it defines only a single method,
GetObjectData():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// When you wish to tweak the serialization process,</span>
<span class="rem">// implement ISerializable.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> ISerializable
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info,
        StreamingContext context);
}</pre>
<p>The GetObjectData() method is called automatically by a given formatter during the serialization
process. The implementation of this method populates the incoming SerializationInfo parameter with
a series of name/value pairs that (typically) map to the field data of the object being persisted.
SerializationInfo defines numerous variations on the overloaded AddValue() method, as well as a small
set of properties that allow the type to get and set the type’s name, defining assembly, and member
count. Here is a partial snapshot:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> SerializationInfo
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SerializationInfo(Type type, IFormatterConverter converter);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> AssemblyName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> FullTypeName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> MemberCount { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddValue(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">short</span> value);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddValue(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">ushort</span> value);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddValue(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> value);
...
}</pre>
<p>Types that implement the ISerializable interface must also define a special constructor that takes
the following signature:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// You must supply a custom constructor with this signature</span>
<span class="rem">// to allow the runtime engine to set the state of your object.</span>
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SomeClass : ISerializable
{
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> SomeClass (SerializationInfo si, StreamingContext ctx) {...}
    ...
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the visibility of this constructor is set as protected. This is permissible because the
formatter will have access to this member, regardless of its visibility. These special constructors tend to
be marked as protected (or private for that matter) to ensure that the casual object user can never create
an object in this manner. The first parameter of this constructor is an instance of the SerializationInfo
type (which you’ve seen previously).</p>
<p>The second parameter of this special constructor is a StreamingContext type, which contains
information regarding the source of the bits. The most informative member of StreamingContext is the
State property, which represents a value from the StreamingContextStates enumeration. The values of
this enumeration represent the basic composition of the current stream.</p>
<p>Unless you intend to implement some low-level custom remoting services, you will seldom need to
deal with this enumeration directly. Nevertheless, here are the possible names of the
StreamingContextStates enum (consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> StreamingContextStates
{
    CrossProcess,
    CrossMachine,
    File,
    Persistence,
    Remoting,
    Other,
    Clone,
    CrossAppDomain,
    All
}</pre>
<p>Now let’s look at how to customize the serialization process using ISerializable. Assume you have
a new Console Application project (named CustomSerialization) that defines a class type containing
two points of string data. Also assume that you must ensure that the string objects are serialized to the
stream all uppercase and deserialized from the stream in lowercase. To account for such rules, you could
implement ISerializable like this (be sure to import the System.Runtime.Serialization namespace):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">class</span> StringData : ISerializable
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> dataItemOne = <span class="str">"First data block"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> dataItemTwo= <span class="str">"More data"</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> StringData(){}
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> StringData(SerializationInfo si, StreamingContext ctx)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Rehydrate member variables from stream.</span>
        dataItemOne = si.GetString(<span class="str">"First_Item"</span>).ToLower();
        dataItemTwo = si.GetString(<span class="str">"dataItemTwo"</span>).ToLower();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">void</span> ISerializable.GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext ctx)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Fill up the SerializationInfo object with the formatted data.</span>
        info.AddValue(<span class="str">"First_Item"</span>, dataItemOne.ToUpper());
        info.AddValue(<span class="str">"dataItemTwo"</span>, dataItemTwo.ToUpper());
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that when you fill the SerializationInfo type with the GetObjectData() method, you are not
required to name the data points identically to the type’s internal member variables. This can obviously
be helpful if you need to further decouple the type’s data from the persisted format. Be aware, however,
that you will need to obtain the values from the special, protected constructor using the same names
assigned within GetObjectData().</p>
<p>To test your customization, assume that you want to persist an instance of MyStringData using a
SoapFormatter (so update your assembly references and imports accordingly):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Custom Serialization *****"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Recall that this type implements ISerializable.</span>
    StringData myData = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringData();

    <span class="rem">// Save to a local file in SOAP format.</span>
    SoapFormatter soapFormat = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SoapFormatter();
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(Stream fStream = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileStream(<span class="str">"MyData.soap"</span>,
        FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None))
    {
        soapFormat.Serialize(fStream, myData);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>When you view the resulting *.soap file, you will see that the string fields have been persisted in
uppercase (see Figure 20-7).</p>

<h2>Customizing Serialization Using Attributes</h2>
<p>Although implementing the ISerializable interface is one way to customize the serialization process,
the preferred way to customize the serialization process since the release of .NET 2.0 is to define
methods that are attributed with any of the new serialization-centric attributes: [OnSerializing],
[OnSerialized], [OnDeserializing], or [OnDeserialized]. Using these attributes is less cumbersome
than implementing ISerializable because you do not need to interact manually with an incoming
SerializationInfo parameter. Instead, you can modify your state data directly, while the formatter
operates on the type.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You can find these serialization attributes defined in the System.Runtime.Serialization
namespace.</p>
<p>When you define method decorated with these attributes, you must define the methods so they
receive a StreamingContext parameter and return nothing (otherwise, you will receive a runtime
exception). Note that you are not required to account for each of the serialization-centric attributes, and
you can simply contend with the stages of serialization you want to intercept. The following snippet
illustrates this. Here, a new [Serializable] type has the same requirements as StringData, but this time
you account for using the [OnSerializing] and [OnDeserialized] attributes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MoreData
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> dataItemOne = <span class="str">"First data block"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> dataItemTwo= <span class="str">"More data"</span>;

    [OnSerializing]
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnSerializing(StreamingContext context)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Called during the serialization process.</span>
        dataItemOne = dataItemOne.ToUpper();
        dataItemTwo = dataItemTwo.ToUpper();
    }

    [OnDeserialized]
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnDeserialized(StreamingContext context)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Called once the deserialization process is complete.</span>
        dataItemOne = dataItemOne.ToLower();
        dataItemTwo = dataItemTwo.ToLower();
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you were to serialize this new type, you would again find that the data has been persisted as
uppercase and deserialized as lowercase.</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> You can find the CustomSerialization project under the Chapter 20 subdirectory.</p>
<p>With this example behind you, your exploration of the core details of object serialization services,
including various ways to customize the process, is complete. As you have seen, the serialization and
deserialization process makes it easy to persist large amounts of data, and it can be less labor-intensive
than working with the various reader/writer classes of the System.IO namespace.</p>
