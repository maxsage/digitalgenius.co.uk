<h1>Understanding Operator Overloading</h1>
  <p>C#, like any programming language, has a canned set of tokens that are used to perform basic operations
on intrinsic types. For example, you know that the + operator can be applied to two integers in order to
yield a larger integer:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The + operator with ints.</span>
<span class="kwrd">int</span> a = 100;
<span class="kwrd">int</span> b = 240;
<span class="kwrd">int</span> c = a + b; <span class="rem">// c is now 340</span></pre>
<p>Once again, this is no major newsflash, but have you ever stopped and noticed how the same +
operator can be applied to most intrinsic C# data types? For example, consider this code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// + operator with strings.</span>
<span class="kwrd">string</span> s1 = <span class="str">"Hello"</span>;
<span class="kwrd">string</span> s2 = <span class="str">" world!"</span>;
<span class="kwrd">string</span> s3 = s1 + s2; <span class="rem">// s3 is now "Hello world!"</span></pre>
<p>In essence, the + operator functions in specific ways based on the supplied data types (strings or
integers in this case). When the + operator is applied to numerical types, the result is the summation of
the operands. However, when the + operator is applied to string types, the result is string concatenation.</p>
<p>The C# language gives you the capability to build custom classes and structures that also respond
uniquely to the same set of basic tokens (such as the + operator). Be aware that you cannot overload
every intrinsic C# operator. Table 12-1 outlines the “overloadability” of the core operators.</p>

 <h2>Overloading Binary Operators</h2>
  <p>To illustrate the process of overloading binary operators, assume the following simple Point class is
defined in a new Console Application named OverloadedOps:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Just a simple, everyday C# class.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Point
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> X {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Y {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Point(<span class="kwrd">int</span> xPos, <span class="kwrd">int</span> yPos)
    {
        X = xPos;
        Y = yPos;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"[{0}, {1}]"</span>, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.X, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Y);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, logically speaking, it makes sense to “add” Points together. For example, if you added together
two Point variables, you should receive a new Point that is the summation of the X and Y values. Of
course, it may also be helpful to subtract one Point from another. Ideally, you would like to be able to
author the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Adding and subtracting two points?</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Overloaded Operators *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make two points.</span>
    Point ptOne = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(100, 100);
    Point ptTwo = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(40, 40);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne = {0}"</span>, ptOne);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptTwo = {0}"</span>, ptTwo);

    <span class="rem">// Add the points to make a bigger point?</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne + ptTwo: {0} "</span>, ptOne + ptTwo);

    <span class="rem">// Subtract the points to make a smaller point?</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne - ptTwo: {0} "</span>, ptOne - ptTwo);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>However, as our Point now stands, we will receive compile-time errors, as the Point type does not
know how to respond to the + or - operators.</p>
<p>To equip a custom type to respond uniquely to intrinsic operators, C# provides the operator
keyword, which you can use only in conjunction with static methods. When you overload a binary
operator (such as + and -), you will most often pass in two arguments that are the same type as the
defining class (a Point in this example), as illustrated in the following code update:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A more intelligent Point type.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Point
{
...
    <span class="rem">// overloaded operator +</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Point <span class="kwrd">operator</span> + (Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(p1.X + p2.X, p1.Y + p2.Y); }
    <span class="rem">// overloaded operator -</span>

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Point <span class="kwrd">operator</span> - (Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(p1.X - p2.X, p1.Y - p2.Y); }
}</pre>
<p>The logic behind operator + is simply to return a brand new Point object based on the summation of
the fields of the incoming Point parameters. Thus, when you write pt1 + pt2, under the hood you can
envision the following hidden call to the static operator + method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Pseudo-code: Point p3 = Point.operator+ (p1, p2)</span>
Point p3 = p1 + p2;</pre>
<p>Likewise, p1 – p2 maps to the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Pseudo-code: Point p4 = Point.operator- (p1, p2)</span>
Point p4 = p1 - p2;</pre>
<p>With this update, our program now compiles, and we find we are able to add and subtract Point
objects:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
ptOne = [100, 100]
ptTwo = [40, 40]
ptOne + ptTwo: [140, 140]
ptOne - ptTwo: [60, 60]
</pre>
<p>When you are overloading a binary operator, you are not required to pass in two parameters of the
same type. If it makes sense to do so, one of the arguments can differ. For example, here is an overloaded
operator + that allows the caller to obtain a new Point that is based on a numerical adjustment:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Point
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Point <span class="kwrd">operator</span> + (Point p1, <span class="kwrd">int</span> change)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(p1.X + change, p1.Y + change);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Point <span class="kwrd">operator</span> + (<span class="kwrd">int</span> change, Point p1)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(p1.X + change, p1.Y + change);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that you need both versions of the method if you want the arguments to be passed in either
order (i.e., you can’t just define one of the methods and expect the compiler to automatically support the
other one). We are now able to use these new versions of operator + as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Prints [110, 110]</span>
Point biggerPoint = ptOne + 10;
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne + 10 = {0}"</span>, biggerPoint);

<span class="rem">// Prints [120, 120]</span>
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"10 + biggerPoint = {0}"</span>, 10 + biggerPoint);
Console.WriteLine();</pre>
<h2>And What of the += and –+ Operators?</h2>
  <p>If you are coming to C# from a C++ background, you may lament the loss of overloading the shorthand
assignment operators (+=, -=, and so forth). Don’t despair. In terms of C#, the shorthand assignment
operators are automatically simulated if a type overloads the related binary operator. Thus, given that
the Point structure has already overloaded the + and - operators, you can write the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Overloading binary operators results in a freebie shorthand operator.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Freebie +=</span>
    Point ptThree = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(90, 5);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptThree = {0}"</span>, ptThree);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptThree += ptTwo: {0}"</span>, ptThree += ptTwo);

    <span class="rem">// Freebie -=</span>
    Point ptFour = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(0, 500);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptFour = {0}"</span>, ptFour);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptFour -= ptThree: {0}"</span>, ptFour -= ptThree);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Overloading Unary Operators</h2>
  <p>C# also allows you to overload various unary operators, such as ++ and --. When you overload a unary
operator, you also define a static method via the operator keyword; however, in this case you simply
pass in a single parameter that is the same type as the defining class/structure. For example, if you were
to update the Point with the following overloaded operators:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Point
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Add 1 to the X/Y values incoming Point.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Point <span class="kwrd">operator</span> ++(Point p1)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(p1.X+1, p1.Y+1); }

    <span class="rem">// Subtract 1 from the X/Y values incoming Point.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Point <span class="kwrd">operator</span> --(Point p1)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(p1.X-1, p1.Y-1); }
}</pre>
<p>you could increment and decrement Point’s x and y values like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Applying the ++ and -- unary operators to a Point.</span>
    Point ptFive = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(1, 1);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"++ptFive = {0}"</span>, ++ptFive); <span class="rem">// [2, 2]</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"--ptFive = {0}"</span>, --ptFive); <span class="rem">// [1, 1]</span>

    <span class="rem">// Apply same operators as postincrement/decrement.</span>
    Point ptSix = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(20, 20);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptSix++ = {0}"</span>, ptSix++); <span class="rem">// [20, 20]</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptSix-- = {0}"</span>, ptSix--); <span class="rem">// [21, 21]</span>
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Notice in the preceding code example we are applying our custom ++ and -- operators in two
different manners. In C++, it is possible to overload pre- and postincrement/decrement operators
separately. This is not possible in C#. However, the return value of the increment/decrement is
automatically handled “correctly” free of charge (i.e., for an overloaded ++ operator, pt++ has the value of
the unmodified object as its value within an expression, while ++pt has the new value applied before use
in the expression).</p>
<h2>Overloading Equality Operators</h2>
  <p>As you may recall from Chapter 6, System.Object.Equals() can be overridden to perform value-based
(rather than referenced-based) comparisons between reference types. If you choose to override Equals()
(and the often related System.Object.GetHashCode() method), it is trivial to overload the equality
operators (== and !=). To illustrate, here is the updated Point type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This incarnation of Point also overloads the == and != operators.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Point
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Equals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> o)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> o.ToString() == <span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetHashCode()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString().GetHashCode(); }

    <span class="rem">// Now let's overload the == and != operators.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> ==(Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> p1.Equals(p2); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> !=(Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> !p1.Equals(p2); }
}</pre>
<p>Notice how the implementation of operator == and operator != simply makes a call to the
overridden Equals() method to get the bulk of the work done. Given this, you can now exercise your
Point class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Make use of the overloaded equality operators.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne == ptTwo : {0}"</span>, ptOne == ptTwo);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne != ptTwo : {0}"</span>, ptOne != ptTwo);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, it is quite intuitive to compare two objects using the well-known == and != operators
rather than making a call to Object. Equals(). If you do overload the equality operators for a given class,
keep in mind that C# demands that if you override the == operator, you must also override the !=
operator (if you forget, the compiler will let you know).</p>
<h2>Overloading Comparison Operators</h2>
  <p>In Chapter 9, you learned how to implement the IComparable interface in order to compare the
relationship between two like objects. You can, in fact, also overload the comparison operators (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=,
and &gt;=) for the same class. As with the equality operators, C# demands that if you overload &lt;, you must
also overload >. The same holds true for the &lt;= and &gt;= operators. If the Point type overloaded these
comparison operators, the object user could now compare Points as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Using the overloaded &lt; and &gt; operators.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne &lt; ptTwo : {0}"</span>, ptOne &lt; ptTwo);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ptOne &gt; ptTwo : {0}"</span>, ptOne &gt; ptTwo);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Assuming you have implemented the IComparable interface, overloading the comparison operators
is trivial. Here is the updated class definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Point is also comparable using the comparison operators.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Point : IComparable
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> CompareTo(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (obj <span class="kwrd">is</span> Point)
        {
            Point p = (Point)obj;
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (<span class="kwrd">this</span>.X &gt; p.X &amp;&amp; <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Y &gt; p.Y)
                <span class="kwrd">return</span> 1;
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (<span class="kwrd">this</span>.X &lt; p.X &amp;&amp; <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Y &lt; p.Y)
                <span class="kwrd">return</span> -1;
            <span class="kwrd">else</span>
                <span class="kwrd">return</span> 0;
        }
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
            <span class="kwrd">throw</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArgumentException();
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> &lt;(Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (p1.CompareTo(p2) &lt; 0); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> &gt;(Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (p1.CompareTo(p2) &gt; 0); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> &lt;=(Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (p1.CompareTo(p2) &lt;= 0); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> &gt;=(Point p1, Point p2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (p1.CompareTo(p2) &gt;= 0); }
}</pre>
<h2>The Internal Representation of Overloaded Operators</h2>
  <p>Like any C# programming element, overloaded operators are represented using specific CIL syntax. To
begin examining what takes place behind the scenes, open the OverloadedOps.exe assembly using
ildasm.exe. As you can see from Figure 12-1, the overloaded operators are internally expressed via
hidden methods (such as op_Addition(), op_Subtraction(), op_Equality(), and so on).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure12_01.png" alt="Figure 12-1" />
<p><b>Figure 12-1. </b>In terms of CIL, overloaded operators map to hidden methods</p>
<p>Now, if you were to examine the specific CIL instructions for the op_Addition method (the one that
takes two Point parameters), you would find that the specialname method decoration has also been
inserted by the compiler:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig specialname static
    class OverloadedOps.Point
    op_Addition(class OverloadedsOps.Point p1,
        class OverloadedOps.Point p2) cil managed
    {
        ...
    }</pre>
<p>The truth of the matter is that any operator that you may overload equates to a specially named
method in terms of CIL. Table 12-2 documents the C# operator-to-CIL mapping for the most common
C# operators.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts Regarding Operator Overloading</h2>
  <p>As you have seen, C# provides the capability to build types that can respond uniquely to various
intrinsic, well-known operators. Now, before you go and retrofit all your classes to support such
behavior, you must be sure that the operator(s) you are about to overload make some sort of logical
sense in the world at large.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you overloaded the multiplication operator for the MiniVan class. What exactly
would it mean to multiply two MiniVan objects? Not much. In fact, it would be very confusing for
teammates to see the following use of MiniVan objects.</p>

<span class="rem">// Huh?! This is far from intuitive...</span>
MiniVan newVan = myVan * yourVan;</pre>
<p>Overloading operators is generally useful only when you’re building utility types. Strings, points,
rectangles, fractions, and hexagons make good candidates for operator overloading. People, managers,
cars, database connections, and web pages do not. As a rule of thumb, if an overloaded operator makes it
harder for the user to understand a type’s functionality, don’t do it. Use this feature wisely.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that even if you do not generally overload operators for your custom classes,
numerous types in the base class libraries have already done so. For example, the System.Drawing.dll
assembly provides a Windows Forms-centric Point definition that overloads numerous operators.
Notice the operator icon from the Visual Studio 2010 Object Browser shown in Figure 12-2.</p>
