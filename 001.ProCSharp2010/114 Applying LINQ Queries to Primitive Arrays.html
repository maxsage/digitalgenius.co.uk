<h1>Applying LINQ Queries to Primitive Arrays</h1>
  <p>To begin examining LINQ to Objects, let’s build an application that will apply LINQ queries to various
array objects. Create a Console Application named LinqOverArray, and define a static helper method
within the Program class named QueryOverStrings(). In this method, create a string array containing six
or so items of your liking (here I listed out a batch of video games I am currently attempting to finish).
Make sure to have at least two entries which contain numerical values, and a few that have embedded
spaces.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverStrings()
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume we have an array of strings.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};
}</pre>
    <p>Now, update Main() to invoke QueryOverStrings():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with LINQ to Objects *****\n"</span>);
    QueryOverStrings();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>When you have any array of data, it is very common to extract a subset of items based on a given
requirement. Maybe you want to obtain only the subitems that contain a number (e.g., System Shock 2,
Uncharted 2, and Fallout 3), have more or less than some number of characters, or don’t contain
embedded spaces (e.g., Morrowind or Daxter). While you could certainly perform such tasks using
members of the System.Array type and a bit of elbow grease, LINQ query expressions can greatly
simplify the process.</p>
<p>Going on the assumption that you wish to obtain from the array only items that contain an
embedded blank space, and you want these items listed in alphabetical order, you could build the
following LINQ query expression:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverStrings()
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume we have an array of strings.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};

    <span class="rem">// Build a query expression to find the items in the array</span>
    <span class="rem">// that have an embedded space.</span>
    IEnumerable&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>&gt; subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> g <span class="kwrd">in</span> currentVideoGames
        where g.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>) orderby g select g;

    <span class="rem">// Print out the results.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> s <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, s);
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the query expression created here makes use of the from, in, where, orderby, and select
LINQ query operators. You will dig into the formalities of query expression syntax later in this chapter.
However, even now you should be able to read this statement roughly as “Give me the items inside of
currentVideoGames that contain a space, ordered alphabetically.”</p>
<p>Here, each item that matches the search criteria has been given the name “g” (as in “game”);
however, any valid C# variable name would do:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
IEnumerable&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>&gt; subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> game <span class="kwrd">in</span> currentVideoGames
    where game.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>) orderby
    game select game;</pre>
<p>Notice that the returned sequence is held in a variable named subset, typed as a type that
implements the generic version of IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, where T is of type System.String (after all, you are
querying an array of strings). Once you obtain the result set, you then simply print out each item using a
standard foreach construct. If you run your application, you will find the following output:</p> 
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with LINQ to Objects *****
Item: Fallout 3
Item: System Shock 2
Item: Uncharted 2</pre>
<h2>Once Again, Without LINQ</h2>
  <p>To be sure, LINQ is never necessary. If you so choose, you could have found the same result set by
forgoing LINQ altogether and making use of programming primitives such as if statements and for loops.
Here is a method which yields the same result as the QueryOverStrings() method, but in a much more
verbose manner:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverStringsLongHand()
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume we have an array of strings.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};

    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] gamesWithSpaces = <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>[5];

    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; currentVideoGames.Length; i++)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (currentVideoGames[i].Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>))
            gamesWithSpaces[i] = currentVideoGames[i];
    }

    <span class="rem">// Now sort them.</span>
    Array.Sort(gamesWithSpaces);

    <span class="rem">// Print out the results.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> s <span class="kwrd">in</span> gamesWithSpaces)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span>( s != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, s);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>While I am sure you can think of ways to tweak the previous method, the fact remains that LINQ
queries can be used to radically simplify the process of extracting new subsets of data from a source.
Rather than building nested loops, complex if/else logic, temporary data types, and so on, the C#
compiler will perform the dirty work on your behalf, once you create a fitting LINQ query.</p>
<h2>Reflecting Over a LINQ Result Set</h2>
  <p>Now, assume the Program class defines an additional helper function named ReflectOverQueryResults()
that will print out various details of the LINQ result set (note the parameter is a System.Object, to
account for multiple types of result sets):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ReflectOverQueryResults(<span class="kwrd">object</span> resultSet)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Info about your query *****"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"resultSet is of type: {0}"</span>, resultSet.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"resultSet location: {0}"</span>,
        resultSet.GetType().Assembly.GetName().Name);
}</pre>
<p>Assuming you have called this method within QueryOverStrings() directly after printing out the
obtained subset, if you run the application, you will see the subset is really an instance of the generic
OrderedEnumerable&lt;TElement, TKey&gt; type (represented in terms of CIL code as OrderedEnumerable`2),
which is an internal abstract type residing in the System.Core.dll assembly:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Info about your query *****
resultSet is of type: OrderedEnumerable`2
resultSet location: System.Core
</pre>
<p><b>Note </b>Many of the types that represent a LINQ result are hidden by the Visual Studio 2010 object browser. Make
use of ildasm.exe or reflector.exe to see these internal, hidden types if you are interested.</p>
<h2>LINQ and Implicitly Typed Local Variables</h2>
  <p>While the current sample program makes it relatively easy to determine that the result set can be
captured as an enumeration of string object (e.g., IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;), I would guess that it is not
clear that subset is really of type OrderedEnumerable&lt;TElement, TKey&gt;.</p>
<p>Given the fact that LINQ result sets can be represented using a good number of types in various
LINQ-centric namespaces, it would be tedious to define the proper type to hold a result set, because in
many cases the underlying type may not be obvious or even directly accessible from your code base (and
as you will see, in some cases the type is generated at compile time).</p>
<p>To further accentuate this point, consider the following additional helper method defined within
the Program class (which I assume you will invoke from within the Main() method):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverInts()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2, 3, 8};

    <span class="rem">// Only print items less than 10.</span>
    IEnumerable&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt; subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i;

    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, i);
    ReflectOverQueryResults(subset);
}</pre>
<p>In this case, the subset variable is a completely different underlying type. This time, the type
implementing the IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; interface is a low-level class named WhereArrayIterator&lt;T&gt;:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
Item: 1
Item: 2
Item: 3
Item: 8

***** Info about your query *****
resultSet is of type: WhereArrayIterator`1
resultSet location: System.Core
</pre>
<p>Given the fact that the exact underlying type of a LINQ query is certainly not obvious, these first
examples have represented the query results as an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; variable, where T is the type of data in
the returned sequence (string, int, etc). However, this is still rather cumbersome. To add insult to
injury, given that IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; extends the nongeneric IEnumerable interface, it would also be
permissible to capture the result of a LINQ query as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
System.Collections.IEnumerable subset =
    <span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i;</pre>
<p>Thankfully, implicit typing cleans things up considerably when working with LINQ queries:</p> 
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverInts()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2, 3, 8};

    <span class="rem">// Use implicit typing here...</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i;

    <span class="rem">// ...and here.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0} "</span>, i);
    
    ReflectOverQueryResults(subset);
}</pre>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you will always want to make use of implicit typing when capturing the results of
a LINQ query. Just remember, however, that (in a vast majority of cases), the real return value is a type
implementing the generic IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; interface.</p>
<p>Exactly what this type is under the covers (OrderedEnumerable&lt;TElement, TKey&gt;,
WhereArrayIterator&lt;T&gt;, etc) is irrelevant, and not necessary to discover. As seen in the previous code
example, you can simply use the var keyword within a foreach construct to iterate over the fetched data.</p>
<h2>LINQ and Extension Methods</h2>
  <p>Although the current example does not have you author any extension methods directly, you are in fact
using them seamlessly in the background. LINQ query expressions can be used to iterate over data
containers that implement the generic IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; interface. However, the .NET System.Array class
type (used to represent our array of strings and array of integers) does not implement this contract:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The System.Array type does not seem to implement the correct</span>
<span class="rem">// infrastructure for query expressions!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Array : ICloneable, IList, ICollection,
IEnumerable, IStructuralComparable, IStructuralEquatable
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>While System.Array does not directly implement the IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; interface, it indirectly gains the
required functionality of this type (as well as many other LINQ-centric members) via the static
System.Linq.Enumerable class type.</p>
<p>This utility class defines a good number of generic extension methods (such as Aggregate&lt;T&gt;(),
First&lt;T&gt;(), Max&lt;T&gt;(), etc.), which System.Array (and other types) acquire in the background. Thus, if
you apply the dot operator on the currentVideoGames local variable, you will find a good number of
members not found within the formal definition of System.Array (see Figure 13-1).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure13_01.png" alt="Figure 13-1" />
<p><b>Figure 13-1. </b>The System.Array type has been extended with members of System.Linq.Enumerable</p>
<h2>The Role of Deferred Execution</h2>
  <p>Another important point regarding LINQ query expressions is that they are not actually evaluated until
you iterate over the sequence. Formally speaking, this is termed deferred execution. The benefit of this
approach is that you are able to apply the same LINQ query multiple times to the same container, and
rest assured you are obtaining the latest and greatest results. Consider the following update to the
QueryOverInts() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverInts()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2, 3, 8 };

    <span class="rem">// Get numbers less than ten.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i;

    <span class="rem">// LINQ statement evaluated here!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} &lt; 10"</span>, i);
    Console.WriteLine();

    <span class="rem">// Change some data in the array.</span>
    numbers[0] = 4;

    <span class="rem">// Evaluated again!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> j <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} &lt; 10"</span>, j);

    Console.WriteLine();
    ReflectOverQueryResults(subset);
}</pre>
<p>If you were to execute the program yet again, you will find the following output. Notice that the
second time you iterate over the requested sequence, you find an additional member, as you set the first
item in the array to be a value less than ten:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
1 &lt; 10
2 &lt; 10
3 &lt; 10
8 &lt; 10

4 &lt; 10
1 &lt; 10
2 &lt; 10
3 &lt; 10
8 &lt; 10</pre>
 <p> One very useful aspect of Visual Studio 2010 is that if you set a breakpoint before the evaluation of a
LINQ query, you are able to view the contents during a debugging session. Simply locate your mouse
cursor above the LINQ result set variable (subset in Figure 13-2). When you do, you will be given the
option of evaluating the query at that time by expanding the Results View option.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure13_02.png" alt="Figure 13-2" />
<p><b>Figure 13-2. </b>Debugging LINQ expressions</p>
<h2>The Role of Immediate Execution</h2>
  <p>When you wish to evaluate a LINQ expression from outside the confines of foreach logic, you are able to
call any number of extension methods defined by the Enumerable type as ToArray&lt;T&gt;(),
ToDictionary&lt;TSource,TKey&gt;(), and ToList&lt;T&gt;(). These methods will cause a LINQ query to execute at
the exact moment you call them, to obtain a snapshot of the data. Once you have done so, the snapshot
of data may be independently manipulated:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ImmediateExecution()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2, 3, 8 };

    <span class="rem">// Get data RIGHT NOW as int[].</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] subsetAsIntArray =
        (<span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i).ToArray&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;();

    <span class="rem">// Get data RIGHT NOW as List&lt;int&gt;.</span>
    List&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt; subsetAsListOfInts =
        (<span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i).ToList&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the entire LINQ expression is wrapped within parentheses to cast it into the correct
underlying type (whatever that may be) in order to call the extension methods of Enumerable.</p>
<p>Also recall from Chapter 10 that when the C# compiler can unambiguously determine the type
parameter of a generic item, you are not required to specify the type parameter. Thus, you could also call
ToArray&lt;T&gt;() (or ToList&lt;T&gt;() for that matter) as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">int</span>[] subsetAsIntArray =
    (<span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i).ToArray();</pre>
 <p>The usefulness of immediate execution is very obvious when you need to return the results of a LINQ
query to an external caller. And, as luck would have it, this happens to be the next topic of the chapter!</p>
