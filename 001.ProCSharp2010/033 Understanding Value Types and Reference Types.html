    <h1>Understanding Value Types and Reference Types</h1>
    <p><b>Note</b> The following discussion of value types and reference types assumes that you have a background in
    object-oriented programming. If this is not the case, you may wish to skip to the final section in this chapter
    (Understanding C# Nullable Types) and return to this section once you have read Chapters 5 and 6.</p>
    <p>Unlike arrays, strings, or enumerations, C# structures do not have an identically named representation
    in the .NET library (that is, there is no System.Structure class), but are implicitly derived from
    System.ValueType. Simply put, the role of System.ValueType is to ensure that the derived type (e.g., any
    structure) is allocated on the stack rather than the garbage collected heap. Simply put, data allocated on
    the stack can be created and destroyed very quickly, as its lifetime is determined by the defining scope.
    Heap allocated data, on the other hand, is monitored by the .NET garbage collector, and has a lifetime
    that is determined by a large number of factors.</p>
    <p>Functionally, the only purpose of System.ValueType is to override the virtual methods defined by
    System.Object to use value-based, versus reference-based, semantics. As you may know, overriding is
    the process of changing the implementation of a virtual (or possibly abstract) method defined within a
    base class. The base class of ValueType is System.Object. In fact, the instance methods defined by
    System.ValueType are identical to those of System.Object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Structures and enumerations implicitly extend System.ValueType.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ValueType : <span class="kwrd">object</span>
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Equals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetHashCode();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Type GetType();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString();
}

</pre>
    <p>Given the fact that value types are using value-based semantics, the lifetime of a structure (which
    includes all numerical data types [int, float], as well as any enum or custom structure) is very predictable.
    When a structure variable falls out of the defining scope, it is removed from memory immediately:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Local structures are popped off</span>
<span class="rem">// the stack when a method returns.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> LocalValueTypes()
{

    <span class="rem">// Recall! "int" is really a System.Int32 structure.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0;

    <span class="rem">// Recall! Point is a structure type.</span>
    Point p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point();
} <span class="rem">// "i" and "p" popped off the stack here!   </span></pre>
    <h2>Value Types, References Types, and the Assignment Operator</h2>
    <p>When you assign one value type to another, a member-by-member copy of the field data is achieved. In
    the case of a simple data type such as System.Int32, the only member to copy is the numerical value.
    However, in the case of your Point, the X and Y values are copied into the new structure variable. To
    illustrate, create a new Console Application project named ValueAndReferenceTypes, then copy your
    previous Point definition into your new namespace. Next, add the following method to your Program
    type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Assigning two intrinsic value types results in</span>
<span class="rem">// two independent variables on the stack.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ValueTypeAssignment()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Assigning value types\n"</span>);

    Point p1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(10, 10);
    Point p2 = p1;

    <span class="rem">// Print both points.</span>
    p1.Display();
    p2.Display();

    <span class="rem">// Change p1.X and print again. p2.X is not changed.</span>
    p1.X = 100;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\n=&gt; Changed p1.X\n"</span>);
    p1.Display();
    p2.Display();
}</pre>
    <p>Here you have created a variable of type Point (named p1) that is then assigned to another Point
    (p2). Because Point is a value type, you have two copies of the MyPoint type on the stack, each of which
    can be independently manipulated. Therefore, when you change the value of p1.X, the value of p2.X is
    unaffected:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Assigning value types

X = 10, Y = 10
X = 10, Y = 10

=&gt; Changed p1.X

X = 100, Y = 10
X = 10, Y = 10</pre>
    <p>In stark contrast to value types, when you apply the assignment operator to reference types
    (meaning all class instances), you are redirecting what the reference variable points to in memory. To
    illustrate, create a new class type named PointRef that has the exact same members as the Point
    structures, beyond renaming the constructor to match the class name:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Classes are always reference types.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> PointRef
{
    <span class="rem">// Same members as the Point structure...</span>

    <span class="rem">// Be sure to change your constructor name to PointRef!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> PointRef(<span class="kwrd">int</span> XPos, <span class="kwrd">int</span> YPos)
    {
        X = XPos;
        Y = YPos;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Now, make use of your PointRef type within the following new method. Note that beyond using the
    PointRef class, rather than the Point structure, the code is identical to the ValueTypeAssignment()
    method.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ReferenceTypeAssignment()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Assigning reference types\n"</span>);
    PointRef p1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PointRef(10, 10);
    PointRef p2 = p1;

    <span class="rem">// Print both point refs.</span>
    p1.Display();
    p2.Display();

    <span class="rem">// Change p1.X and print again.</span>
    p1.X = 100;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\n=&gt; Changed p1.X\n"</span>);
    p1.Display();
    p2.Display();
}</pre>
    <p>In this case, you have two references pointing to the same object on the managed heap. Therefore,
    when you change the value of X using the p2 reference, p1.X reports the same value. Assuming you have
    called this new method within Main(), your output should look like the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Assigning reference types

X = 10, Y = 10
X = 10, Y = 10

=&gt; Changed p1.X

X = 100, Y = 10
X = 100, Y = 10</pre>
    <h2>Value Types Containing Reference Types</h2>
     <p>Now that you have a better feeling for the basic differences between value types and reference types,
    let's examine a more complex example. Assume you have the following reference (class) type that
    maintains an informational string that can be set using a custom constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> ShapeInfo
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> infoString;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> ShapeInfo(<span class="kwrd">string</span> info)
    { infoString = info; }
}</pre>
    <p>Now assume that you want to contain a variable of this class type within a value type named
    Rectangle. To allow the caller to set the value of the inner ShapeInfo member variable, you also provide a
    custom constructor. Here is the complete definition of the Rectangle type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">struct</span> Rectangle
{
    <span class="rem">// The Rectangle structure contains a reference type member.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> ShapeInfo rectInfo;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> rectTop, rectLeft, rectBottom, rectRight;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Rectangle(<span class="kwrd">string</span> info, <span class="kwrd">int</span> top, <span class="kwrd">int</span> left, <span class="kwrd">int</span> bottom, <span class="kwrd">int</span> right)
    {
        rectInfo = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ShapeInfo(info);
        rectTop = top; rectBottom = bottom;
        rectLeft = left; rectRight = right;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"String = {0}, Top = {1}, Bottom = {2}, "</span> +
            <span class="str">"Left = {3}, Right = {4}"</span>,
            rectInfo.infoString, rectTop, rectBottom, rectLeft, rectRight);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>At this point, you have contained a reference type within a value type. The million dollar question
    now becomes, what happens if you assign one Rectangle variable to another?Given what you already
    know about value types, you would be correct in assuming that the integer data (which is indeed a
    structure) should be an independent entity for each Rectangle variable. But what about the internal
    reference type? Will the object's state be fully copied, or will the reference to that object be copied? To
    answer this question, define the following method and invoke it from Main().</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ValueTypeContainingRefType()
{
    <span class="rem">// Create the first Rectangle.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Creating r1"</span>);
    Rectangle r1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(<span class="str">"First Rect"</span>, 10, 10, 50, 50);

    <span class="rem">// Now assign a new Rectangle to r1.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Assigning r2 to r1"</span>);
    Rectangle r2 = r1;

    <span class="rem">// Change some values of r2.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Changing values of r2"</span>);
    r2.rectInfo.infoString = <span class="str">"This is new info!"</span>;
    r2.rectBottom = 4444;

    <span class="rem">// Print values of both rectangles.</span>
    r1.Display();
    r2.Display();
}
</pre>
    <p>The output can been seen in the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
-&gt; Creating r1
-&gt; Assigning r2 to r1
-&gt; Changing values of r2
String = This is new info!, Top = 10, Bottom = 50, Left = 10, Right = 50
String = This is new info!, Top = 10, Bottom = 4444, Left = 10, Right = 50</pre>  
    <p>As you can see, when you change the value of the informational string using the r2 reference, the r1
    reference displays the same value. By default, when a value type contains other reference types,
    assignment results in a copy of the references. In this way, you have two independent structures, each of
    which contains a reference pointing to the same object in memory (i.e., a shallow copy). When you want
    to perform a deep copy, where the state of internal references is fully copied into a new object, one
    approach is to implement the ICloneable interface</p>
    <h2>Passing Reference Types by Value</h2>
    <p>"Reference types or value types can obviously be passed as parameters to methods. However, passing a 
    reference type (e.g., a class) by reference is quite different from passing it by value. To understand 
    the distinction, assume you have a simple Person class defined in a new Console Application project 
    named RefTypeValTypeParams, defined as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Person
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> personName;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> personAge;

    <span class="rem">// Constructors.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age)
    {
        personName = name;
        personAge = age;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person(){}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Name: {0}, Age: {1}"</span>, personName, personAge);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Now, what if you create a method that allows the caller to send in the Person object by value (note the 
    lack of parameter modifiers, such as out or ref):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SendAPersonByValue(Person p)
{
    <span class="rem">// Change the age of "p"?</span>
    p.personAge = 99;

    <span class="rem">// Will the caller see this reassignment?</span>
    p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Nikki"</span>, 99);
}</pre>     
    <p>Notice how the SendAPersonByValue() method attempts to reassign the incoming Person reference to a new 
    Person object as well as change some state data. Now let's test this method using the following Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Passing ref-types by value.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Passing Person object by value *****"</span>);
    Person fred = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Fred"</span>, 12);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\nBefore by value call, Person is:"</span>);
    fred.Display();

    SendAPersonByValue(fred);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\nAfter by value call, Person is:"</span>);
    fred.Display();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>           
    <p>The following is the output of this call.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Passing Person <span class="kwrd">object</span> by value *****

Before by value call, Person <span class="kwrd">is</span>:
Name: Fred, Age: 12

After by value call, Person <span class="kwrd">is</span>:
Name: Fred, Age: 133</pre>
    <p>As you can see, the value of personAge has been modified. This behavior seems to fly in the face of
    what it means to pass a parameter "by value." Given that you were able to change the state of the
    incoming Person, what was copied? The answer: a copy of the reference to the caller's object. Therefore,
    as the SendAPersonByValue() method is pointing to the same object as the caller, it is possible to alter the
    object's state data. What is not possible is to reassign what the reference is pointing to.</p>
    <h2>Passing Reference Types by Reference</h2>
     <p>Now assume you have a SendAPersonByReference() method, which passes a reference type by reference
    (note the ref parameter modifier):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SendAPersonByReference(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> Person p)
{
    <span class="rem">// Change some data of "p".</span>
    p.personAge = 555;

    <span class="rem">// "p" is now pointing to a new object on the heap!</span>
    p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Nikki"</span>, 999);
}</pre>
    <p>As you might expect, this allows complete flexibility of how the callee is able to manipulate the
    incoming parameter. Not only can the callee change the state of the object, but if it so chooses, it may
    also reassign the reference to a new Person type. Now ponder the following updated Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Passing ref-types by ref.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Passing Person object by reference *****"</span>);
    Person mel = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Mel"</span>, 23);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Before by ref call, Person is:"</span>);
    mel.Display();

    SendAPersonByReference(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> mel);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After by ref call, Person is:"</span>);
    mel.Display();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Notice the following output:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Passing Person object by reference *****
Before by ref call, Person is:
Name: Mel, Age: 23
After by ref call, Person is:
Name: Nikki, Age: 999</pre>
    <p>As you can see, an object named Mel returns after the call as an object named Nikki, as the method
    was able to change what the incoming reference pointed to in memory. The golden rule to keep in mind
    when passing reference types is the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If a reference type is passed by reference, the callee may change the values of the
        object's state data as well as the object it is referencing.</li>
        <li>If a reference type is passed by value, the callee may change the values of the
        object's state data but not the object it is referencing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Final Details Regarding Value Types and Reference Types</h2>
