<h1>Concurrent Garbage Collection under .NET 1.0 - 3.5</h1>
   <p>Prior to .NET 4.0, the runtime would clean up unused objects using a technique termed concurrent
garbage collection. Under this model, when a collection takes place for any generation 0 or generation 1
objects (recall these are ephemeral generations), the garbage collector temporarily suspends all active
threads within the current process to ensure that the application does not access the managed heap
during the collection process.</p>
<p>We will examine the topic of threads in Chapter 19; however, for the time being, simply regard a
thread as a path of execution within a running executable. Once the garbage collection cycle has
completed, the suspended threads are permitted to carry on their work. Thankfully, the .NET 3.5 (and
earlier) garbage collector was highly optimized; you seldom (if ever) noticed this brief interruption in
your application.</p>
<p>As an optimization, concurrent garbage collection allowed objects that were not located in one of
the ephemeral generations to be cleaned up on a dedicated thread. This decreased (but didnâ€™t eliminate)
the need for the .NET runtime to suspect active threads. Moreover, concurrent garbage collection
allowed your program to continue allocating objects on the heap during the collection of nonephemeral
generations.</p>
<h2>Background Garbage Collection under .NET 4.0</h2>
<p>.NET 4.0 changes the way the garbage collector deals with thread suspension when it cleans up objects
on the managed heap, using background garbage collection. Despite its name, this does not mean that all
garbage collection now takes place on additional background threads of execution. Rather, if a
background garbage collection is taking place for objects living in a non-ephemeral generation, the .NET
runtime is now able to collect objects on the ephemeral generations using a dedicated background
thread.</p>
<p>On a related note, the .NET 4.0 garbage collection has been improved to further reduce the amount
of time a given thread involved with garbage collection details must be suspended. The end result of
these changes is that the process of cleaning up unused objects living in generation 0 or generation 1 has
been optimized and can result in better runtime performance of your programs (which is really
important for real-time systems that require small (and predictable) GC stop time).</p>
<p>Do understand, however, that the introduction of this new garbage collection model has no effect
on how you build your .NET applications. For all practical purposes, you can simply allow the .NET
garbage collector to perform its work without your direct intervention (and be happy that the folks at
Microsoft are improving the collection process in a transparent manner).</p>
