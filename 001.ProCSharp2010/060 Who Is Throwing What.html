<h1>Who Is Throwing What?</h1>
  <p>Given that a method in the .NET Framework could throw any number of exceptions under various
circumstances, a logical question is, “How do I know which exceptions may be thrown by a given base
class library method?” The ultimate answer is simple: consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK
documentation. Each method in the help system documents the exceptions a given member may throw.
As a quick alternative, Visual Studio 2010 allows you to view the list of all exceptions thrown by a base
class library member (if any) simply by hovering your mouse cursor over the member name in the code
window (see Figure 7-2).</p>

<p>For those coming to .NET from a Java background, understand that type members are not
prototyped with the set of exceptions they may throw (in other words, C# does not support checked
exceptions). For better or for worse, you are not required to handle each and every exception thrown
from a given member.</p>
