<h1>The Necessity of Type Metadata</h1>
<p>The ability to fully describe types (classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations, and delegates) using
metadata is a key element of the .NET platform. Numerous .NET technologies, such as object
serialization, .NET remoting, XML web services, and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF),
require the ability to discover the format of types at runtime. Furthermore, cross-language
interoperability, numerous compiler services, and an IDE’s IntelliSense capabilities all rely on a concrete
description of type.</p>
<p>Regardless of (or perhaps due to) its importance, metadata is not a new idea supplied by the .NET
Framework. Java, CORBA, and COM all have similar concepts. For example, COM type libraries (which
are little more than compiled IDL code) are used to describe the types contained within a COM server.
Like COM, .NET code libraries also support type metadata. Of course, .NET metadata has no syntactic
similarities to COM IDL.</p>
<p>Recall that the ildasm.exe utility allows you to view an assembly’s type metadata using the Ctrl+M
keyboard option (see Chapter 1). Thus, if you were to open any of the *.dll or *.exe assemblies created
over the course of this book (such as the CarLibrary.dll created in the previous chapter) using
ildasm.exe and press Ctrl+M, you would find the relevant type metadata (see Figure 15-1).</p>

<p><b>Figure 15-1</b> Viewing an assembly’s metadata using ildasm.exe</p>
<p>As you can see, ildasm.exe’s display of .NET type metadata is very verbose (the actual binary format
is much more compact). In fact, if I were to list the entire metadata description representing the
CarLibrary.dll assembly, it would span several pages. Given that this act would be a woeful waste of
paper, let’s just glimpse into some key metadata descriptions of the CarLibrary.dll assembly.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Don’t be too concerned with the exact syntax of each and every piece of .NET metadata in the next few
sections. The bigger point to absorb is that .NET metadata is very descriptive and lists each internally defined (and
externally referenced) type found within a given code base.</p>
<h2>Viewing (Partial) Metadata for the EngineState Enumeration</h2>
<p>Each type defined within the current assembly is documented using a TypeDef #n token (where TypeDef
is short for type definition). If the type being described uses a type defined within a separate .NET
assembly, the referenced type is documented using a TypeRef #n token (where TypeRef is short for type
reference). A TypeRef token is a pointer (if you will) to the referenced type’s full metadata definition in an
external assembly. In a nutshell, .NET metadata is a set of tables that clearly mark all type definitions
(TypeDefs) and referenced types (TypeRefs), all of which can be viewed using ildasm.exe’s metadata
window.</p>
<p>As far as CarLibrary.dll goes, one TypeDef is the metadata description of the
CarLibrary.EngineState enumeration (your number may differ; TypeDef numbering is based on the
order in which the C# compiler processes the file):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
TypeDef #2 (02000003)
-------------------------------------------------------
    TypDefName: CarLibrary.EngineState (02000003)
    Flags : [Public] [AutoLayout] [Class] [Sealed] [AnsiClass] (00000101)
    Extends : 01000001 [TypeRef] System.Enum
    Field #1 (04000006)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Field Name: value__ (04000006)
    Flags : [Public] [SpecialName] [RTSpecialName] (00000606)
    CallCnvntn: [FIELD]
    Field type: I4

    Field #2 (04000007)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Field Name: engineAlive (04000007)
    Flags : [Public] [Static] [Literal] [HasDefault] (00008056)
    DefltValue: (I4) 0
    CallCnvntn: [FIELD]
    Field type: ValueClass CarLibrary.EngineState
...</pre>
<p>Here, the TypDefName token is used to establish the name of the given type, which in this case is the custom
CarLibrary.EngineState enum. The Extends metadata token is used to document the base type of a given
.NET type (in this case, the referenced type, System.Enum). Each field of an enumeration is marked using the
Field #n token. For brevity, I have simply listed the metadata for CarLibrary.EngineState.engineAlive.</p>
<h2>Viewing (Partial) Metadata for the Car Type</h2>
<p>Here is a partial dump of the Car class that illustrates the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>How fields are defined in terms of .NET metadata</li>
 <li>How methods are documented via .NET metadata</li>
 <li>How an automatic property is represented in .NET metadata</li>
</ul>
<pre class="csharpcode">
TypeDef #3 (02000004)
-------------------------------------------------------
    TypDefName: CarLibrary.Car (02000004)
    Flags : [Public] [AutoLayout] [Class] [Abstract]
        [AnsiClass] [BeforeFieldInit] (00100081)
    Extends : 01000002 [TypeRef] System.Object
...
    Field #2 (0400000a)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Field Name: &lt;PetName&gt;k__BackingField (0400000A)
    Flags : [Private] (00000001)
    CallCnvntn: [FIELD]
    Field type: String
...
Method #1 (06000001)
-------------------------------------------------------
    MethodName: get_PetName (06000001)
    Flags : [Public] [HideBySig] [ReuseSlot] [SpecialName] (00000886)
    RVA : 0x000020d0
    ImplFlags : [IL] [Managed] (00000000)
    CallCnvntn: [DEFAULT]
    hasThis
    ReturnType: String
    No arguments.
...
    Method #2 (06000002)
-------------------------------------------------------
    MethodName: set_PetName (06000002)
    Flags : [Public] [HideBySig] [ReuseSlot] [SpecialName] (00000886)
    RVA : 0x000020e7
    ImplFlags : [IL] [Managed] (00000000)
    CallCnvntn: [DEFAULT]
    hasThis
    ReturnType: Void
    1 Arguments
        Argument #1: String
    1 Parameters
        (1) ParamToken : (08000001) Name : value flags: [none] (00000000)
...
Property #1 (17000001)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Prop.Name : PetName (17000001)
    Flags : [none] (00000000)
    CallCnvntn: [PROPERTY]
    hasThis
    ReturnType: String
    No arguments.
    DefltValue:
    Setter : (06000002) set_PetName
    Getter : (06000001) get_PetName
    0 Others
...</pre>
<p>First, note that the Car class metadata marks the type’s base class (System.Object) and includes
various flags that describe how this type was constructed (e.g., [Public], [Abstract], and whatnot).
Methods (such as our Car’s constructor) are described in regard to their parameters, return value, and
name.</p>
<p>Note how an automatic property results in a compiler generated private backing field (which was
named &lt;PetName&gt;k__BackingField) and two compiler generated methods (in the case of a read/write
property) named in this example, get_PetName() and set_PetName(). Finally, the actual property itself is
mapped to the internal get/set methods using the .NET metadata Getter/Setter tokens.</p>
<h2>Examining a TypeRef</h2>
<p>Recall that an assembly’s metadata will describe not only the set of internal types (Car, EngineState,
etc.), but also any external types the internal types reference. For example, given that CarLibrary.dll has
defined two enumerations, you find a TypeRef block for the System.Enum type:</p>
<pre>
TypeRef #1 (01000001)
-------------------------------------------------------
Token: 0x01000001
ResolutionScope: 0x23000001
TypeRefName: System.Enum</pre>
<h2>Documenting the Defining Assembly</h2>
<p>The ildasm.exe metadata window also allows you to view the .NET metadata that describes the assembly
itself using the Assembly token. As you can see from the following (partial) listing, information
documented within the Assembly table is (surprise, surprise!) the same information that can be viewable
via the MANIFEST icon. The following is a partial dump of the manifest of CarLibrary.dll (version
2.0.0.0):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
Assembly
-------------------------------------------------------
    Token: 0x20000001
    Name : CarLibrary
    Public Key : 00 24 00 00 04 80 00 00 // Etc...

    Hash Algorithm : 0x00008004
    Major Version: 0x00000002
    Minor Version: 0x00000000
    Build Number: 0x00000000
    Revision Number: 0x00000000
    Locale: &LT;null&gt;
    Flags : [PublicKey] ...</pre>
<h2>Documenting Referenced Assemblies</h2>
<p>In addition to the Assembly token and the set of TypeDef and TypeRef blocks, .NET metadata also makes
use of AssemblyRef #n tokens to document each external assembly. Given that the CarLibrary.dll makes
use of the System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox class, you find an AssemblyRef for the
System.Windows.Forms assembly, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
AssemblyRef #2 (23000002)
-------------------------------------------------------
    Token: 0x23000002
    Public Key or Token: b7 7a 5c 56 19 34 e0 89
    Name: System.Windows.Forms
    Version: 4.0.0.0
    Major Version: 0x00000004
    Minor Version: 0x00000000
    Build Number: 0x00000000
    Revision Number: 0x00000000
    Locale: &lt;null&gt;
    HashValue Blob:
    Flags: [none] (00000000)</pre>
<h2>Documenting String Literals</h2>
<p>The final point of interest regarding .NET metadata is the fact that each and every string literal in your
code base is documented under the User Strings token.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
User Strings
-------------------------------------------------------
70000001 : (11) L"Jamming {0}"
70000019 : (13) L"Quiet time..."
70000035 : (23) L"CarLibrary Version 2.0!"
70000065 : (14) L"Ramming speed!"
70000083 : (19) L"Faster is better..."
700000ab : (16) L"Time to call AAA"
700000cd : (16) L"Your car is dead"</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> As illustrated in this last metadata listing, always be aware that all strings are clearly documented in the
assembly metadata. This could have huge security consequences if you were to use string literals to capture
passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.</p>
<p>The next question on your mind may be (in the best-case scenario) “How can I leverage this
information in my applications?” or (in the worst-case scenario) “Why should I care about metadata?”
To address both points of view, allow me to introduce .NET reflection services. Be aware that the
usefulness of the topics presented over the pages that follow may be a bit of a head-scratcher until this
chapter’s endgame. So hang tight.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You will also find a number of CustomAttribute tokens displayed by the MetaInfo window, which
documents the attributes applied within the code base. You’ll learn about the role of .NET attributes later in this
chapter.</p>
