<h1>Summarizing Processes, AppDomains, and Context</h1>
    <p>At this point, you hopefully have a much better idea about how a .NET assembly is hosted by the CLR. To
summarize the key points:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A .NET process hosts one to many application domains. Each AppDomain is able
to host any number of related .NET assemblies. AppDomains may be
independently loaded and unloaded by the CLR (or programmatically via the
System.AppDomain type).</li>
 <li>A given AppDomain consists of one to many contexts. Using a context, the CLR is
able to place a “special needs” object into a logical container, to ensure that its
runtime requirements are honored.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the previous pages have seemed to be a bit too low level for your liking, fear not. For the most part,
the .NET runtime automatically deals with the details of processes, application domains, and contexts
on your behalf. The good news, however, is that this information provides a solid foundation for
understanding multithreaded programming under the .NET platform.</p>
