    <h1>Understanding the static Keyword</h1>
    <p>A C# class may define any number of static members using the static keyword. When you do so, the member in 
    question must be invoked directly from the class level, rather than from an object reference. To illustrate the 
    distinction, consider your good friend System.Console. As you have seen, you do not invoke the WriteLine() 
    method from the object level:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! WriteLine() is not an object level method!</span>
Console c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Console();
c.WriteLine(<span class="str">"I can't be printed..."</span>);
</pre>
   <p>but instead simply prefix the class name to the static WriteLine() member:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Correct! WriteLine() is a static method.</span>
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Thanks..."</span>);
</pre>
   <p>Simply put, static members are items that are deemed (by the class designer) to be so commonplace that there 
   is no need to create an instance of the type when invoking the member. While any class can define static members, 
   they are most commonly found within "utility classes." For example, if you were to use the Visual Studio 
   2010 object browser (via the View &gt; Object Browser menu item) to view the System namespace of mscorlib.dll, 
   you will see that all of the members of the Console, Math, Environment, and GC classes (among others) 
   expose all of their functionality via static members.</p>
   <h2>Defining Static Methods</h2>
   <p>Assume you have a new Console Application project named StaticMethods and have inserted a class named Teenager 
   that defines a static method named Complain(). This method returns a random string, obtained in part by calling 
   a static helper function named GetRandomNumber():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Teenager
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Random r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Random();
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetRandomNumber(<span class="kwrd">short</span> upperLimit)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> r.Next(upperLimit);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Complain()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] messages = {<span class="str">"Do I have to?"</span>, <span class="str">"He started it!"</span>,
        <span class="str">"I'm too tired..."</span>, <span class="str">"I hate school!"</span>,
        <span class="str">"You are sooooooo wrong!"</span>};
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> messages[GetRandomNumber(5)];
    }
}</pre>
   <p>Notice that the System.Random member variable and the GetRandomNumber() helper function method have also been 
   declared as static members of the Teenager class, given the rule that static members such as the Complain() 
   method can operate only on other static members.</p>
   <p><b>Note </b> Allow me to repeat myself: static members can operate only on static data and call static methods 
   of the defining class. If you attempt to make use of nonstatic class data or call a nonstatic method of the class 
   within a static member's implementation, you'll receive compile-time errors.</p>
   <p>Like any static member, to call Complain(), prefix the name of the defining class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Static Methods *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">for</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i =0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    Console.WriteLine(Teenager.Complain());
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <h2>Defining Static Field Data</h2>
    <p>In addition to static methods, a class (or structure) may also define static field data such as the Random 
    member variable seen in the previous Teenager class. Understand that when a class defines nonstatic data (properly
    referred to as instance data), each object of this type maintains an independent copy of the field. For example, 
    assume a class that models a savings account is defined in a new Console Application project named StaticData:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple savings account class.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SavingsAccount
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currBalance;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SavingsAccount(<span class="kwrd">double</span> balance)
    {
        currBalance = balance;
    }
}</pre>
   <p>When you create SavingsAccount objects, memory for the currBalance field is allocated for each object. 
   Static data, on the other hand, is allocated once and shared among all objects of the same class category. To 
   illustrate the usefulness of static data, add a static point of data named currInterestRate to the SavingsAccount 
   class, which is set to a default value of 0.04:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple savings account class.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SavingsAccount
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currBalance;
    
    <span class="rem">// A static point of data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currInterestRate = 0.04;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SavingsAccount(<span class="kwrd">double</span> balance)
    {
        currBalance = balance;
    }
}</pre>
   <p>If you were to create three instances of SavingsAccount in Main() as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Static Data *****\n"</span>);
    SavingsAccount s1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SavingsAccount(50);
    SavingsAccount s2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SavingsAccount(100);
    SavingsAccount s3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SavingsAccount(10000.75);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>   
   <p>the in-memory data allocation would look something like Figure 5-3.</p>
   <img src="../Images/Figure05_03.png" alt="Figure 5-3" />
   <p><b>Figure 5-3</b> Static data is allocated once and shared among all instances of the class</p>
   <p>Let's update the SavingsAccount class to define two static methods to get and set the interest rate value:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple savings account class.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SavingsAccount
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currBalance;

    <span class="rem">// A static point of data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currInterestRate = 0.04;
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SavingsAccount(<span class="kwrd">double</span> balance)
    {
        currBalance = balance;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Static members to get/set interest rate.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetInterestRate(<span class="kwrd">double</span> newRate )
    { currInterestRate = newRate; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> GetInterestRate()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> currInterestRate; }
}  </pre> 
   <p>Now, observe the following usage:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Static Data *****\n"</span>);
    SavingsAccount s1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SavingsAccount(50);
    SavingsAccount s2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SavingsAccount(100);

    <span class="rem">// Print the current interest rate.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Interest Rate is: {0}"</span>, SavingsAccount.GetInterestRate());
    <span class="rem">// Make new object, this does NOT 'reset' the interest rate.</span>
    SavingsAccount s3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SavingsAccount(10000.75);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Interest Rate is: {0}"</span>, SavingsAccount.GetInterestRate());
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
   <p>The output of the previous Main() is seen here:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Static Data *****

In static ctor!
Interest Rate is: 0.04
Interest Rate is: 0.04
</pre>
    <p>As you can see, when you create new instances of the SavingsAccount class, the value of the static data is not
    reset, as the CLR will allocate the data into memory exactly one time. After that point, all objects of type 
    SavingsAccount operate on the same value.</p>
    <p>When designing any C# class, one of your design challenges is to determine which pieces of data should be 
    defined as static members, and which should not. While there are no hard and fast rules, remember that a static 
    data field is shared by all objects. Therefore, if you are defining a point of data that all objects should 
    share between them, static is the way to go.</p>
    <p>Consider what would happen if the interest rate variable were not defined using the static keyword. This 
    would mean every SavingsAccount object would have its own copy of the currInterestRate field. Now, assume you 
    created 100 SavingsAccount objects, and need to change the interest rate. That would require you to call the 
    SetInterestRateObj() method 100 times! Clearly, this would not be a very useful way to model shared data. 
    Again, static data is perfect when you have a value that should be common to all objects of that category.</p>
    <h2>Defining Static Constructors</h2>
    <p>Recall that constructors are used to set the value of an object's data at the time of creation. Thus, 
    if you were to assign a value to a static data member within an instance-level constructor, you may be 
    surprised to find that the value is reset each time you create a new object! For example, assume you have
    updated the SavingsAccount class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SavingsAccount
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currBalance;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currInterestRate;

    <span class="rem">// Notice that our constructor is setting</span>
    <span class="rem">// the static currInterestRate value.</span>

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SavingsAccount(<span class="kwrd">double</span> balance)
    {
        currInterestRate = 0.04;
        currBalance = balance;
    }
...
}</pre>   
    <p>If you execute the previous Main() method, you would see that that the currInterestRate variable is reset
    each time you create a new SavingsAccount object, and it is always set to 0.04. Clearly, setting the values 
    of static data in a normal instance level constructor sort of defeats the whole purpose. Every time you make 
    a new object, the class level data is reset! One approach to setting a static field is to use member initialization 
    syntax, as you did originally:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SavingsAccount
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currBalance;

    <span class="rem">// A static point of data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currInterestRate = 0.04;
...
}</pre>
   <p>This approach will ensure the static field is assigned only once, regardless of how many objects you create. 
   However, what if the value for your static data needed to be obtained at runtime? For example, in a typical 
   banking application, the value of an interest rate variable would be read from a database or external file. 
   To perform such tasks requires a method scope such as a constructor to execute the code statements.</p>
   <p>For this very reason, C# allows you to define a static constructor, which allows you to safely set the 
   values of your static data. Consider the following update:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SavingsAccount
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currBalance;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> currInterestRate;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SavingsAccount(<span class="kwrd">double</span> balance)
    {
        currBalance = balance;
    }

    <span class="rem">// A static constructor!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> SavingsAccount()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"In static ctor!"</span>);
        currInterestRate = 0.04;
    }
...
} </pre>  
    <p>Simply put, a static constructor is a special constructor that is an ideal place to initialize the
    values of static data when the value is not known at compile time (e.g., you need to read in the value 
    from an external file or generate a random number). Here are a few points of interest regarding static 
    constructors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A given class may define only a single static constructor. In other words, the static 
        constructor cannot be overloaded.</li>
        <li>A static constructor does not take an access modifier and cannot take any parameters.</li>
        <li>A static constructor executes exactly one time, regardless of how many objects of the type 
        are created.</li>
        <li>The runtime invokes the static constructor when it creates an instance of the class or before 
        accessing 
        the first static member invoked by the caller.</li>
        <li>The static constructor executes before any instance-level constructors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given this modification, when you create new SavingsAccount objects, the value of the static
    data is preserved, as the static member is set only one time within the static constructor, regardless 
    of the number of objects created.</p>
    <h2>Defining Static Classes</h2>
    <p>It is also possible to apply the static keyword directly on the class level. When a class has 
    been defined as static, it is not creatable using the new keyword, and it can contain only members 
    or fields marked with the static keyword. If this is not the case, you receive compiler errors.</p>
   <p><b>Note</b> Class or structures that only expose static functionality are often termed utility classes. 
   When designing a utility class, it is good practice to apply the static keyword to the class definition.</p>
   <p>At first glance, this might seem like a fairly useless feature, given that a class that cannot be 
   created does not appear all that helpful. However, if you create a class that contains nothing but 
   static members and/or constant data, the class has no need to be allocated in the first place. Consider 
   the following new static class type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Static classes can only</span>
<span class="rem">// contain static members!</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> TimeUtilClass
{
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintTime()
{ Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()); }
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintDate()
{ Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Today.ToShortDateString()); }
}
   &lt;p&gt;Given that <span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> has been defined with the <span class="kwrd">static</span> keyword, you cannot create an instance of 
   TimeUtilClass <span class="kwrd">using</span> the <span class="kwrd">new</span> keyword. Rather, all functionality <span class="kwrd">is</span> exposed <span class="kwrd">from</span> the <span class="kwrd">class</span> level:&lt;/p&gt;
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Static Data *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// This is just fine.</span>
    TimeUtilClass.PrintDate();
    TimeUtilClass.PrintTime();

    <span class="rem">// Compiler error! Can't create static classes!</span>
    TimeUtilClass u = <span class="kwrd">new</span> TimeUtilClass ();
...
}</pre>
   <p>Before the introduction of static class declaration (introduced in .NET 2.0), the only way to 
   prevent the creation of a class that only exposed static functionality was to either redefine the
   default constructor using the private keyword or mark the class as an abstract type using the C# 
   abstract keyword. Consider the following approaches:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> TimeUtilClass2
{
    <span class="rem">// Redefine the default ctor as private</span>
    <span class="rem">// to prevent creation.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> TimeUtilClass2 (){}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintTime()
    { Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()); }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintDate()
    { Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Today.ToShortDateString()); }
}

<span class="rem">// Define type as abstract to prevent</span>
<span class="rem">// creation.</span>
<span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> TimeUtilClass3
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintTime()
    { Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()); }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintDate()
    { Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Today.ToShortDateString()); }
}</pre>
   <p>While these constructs are still permissible, the use of static classes is a cleaner solution 
   and more type-safe, given that the previous two techniques allowed nonstatic members to appear within 
   the class definition without error. This would be a big problem! If you had a class that was no longer 
   creatable, you would have a chunk of functionality (e.g., all the non-static items) which could 
   not be used!</p>
   <p>At this point in the chapter you hopefully feel comfortable defining simple class types containing
	constructors, fields, and various static (and nonstatic) members. Now that you have the basics under
	your belt, you can formally investigate the three pillars of object-oriented programming.</p>
