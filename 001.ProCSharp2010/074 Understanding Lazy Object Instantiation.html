<h1>Understanding Lazy Object Instantiation</h1>
   <p><b>Note</b> This section assumes you are comfortable with the topics of .NET generics and .NET delegates. If that’s
not the case, you may want to return to this section once you have completed Chapters 10 and 11.</p>
<p>When you are creating classes, you may occasionally need to account for a particular member variable in
code, which may never actually be needed, in that the object user may not call the method (or property)
that makes use of it. Fair enough. However, this can be very problematic if the member variable in
question requires a large amount of memory to be instantiated.</p>
<p>For example, assume you are writing a class that encapsulates the operations of a digital music
player. In addition to the expected methods, such as Play(), Pause(), and Stop(), you also want to
provide the ability to return a collection of Song objects (via a class named AllTracks), which represents
every single digital music file on the device.</p>
<p>If you’d like to follow along, create a new Console Application named LazyObjectInstantiation, and
define the following class types:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Represents a single song.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Song
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Artist { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> TrackName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> TrackLength { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}

<span class="rem">// Represents all songs on a player.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> AllTracks
{
    <span class="rem">// Our media player can have a maximum</span>
    <span class="rem">// of 10,000 songs.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Song[] allSongs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Song[10000];

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> AllTracks()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Assume we fill up the array</span>
        <span class="rem">// of Song objects here.</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Filling up the songs!"</span>);
    }
}

<span class="rem">// The MediaPlayer has-a AllTracks object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MediaPlayer
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume these methods do something useful.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Play() { <span class="rem">/* Play a song */</span> }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Pause() { <span class="rem">/* Pause the song */</span> }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Stop() { <span class="rem">/* Stop playback */</span> }
    
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> AllTracks allSongs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AllTracks();
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> AllTracks GetAllTracks()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Return all of the songs.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> allSongs;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>The current implementation of MediaPlayer makes the assumption that the object user will want to
obtain a list of songs via the GetAllTracks() method. Well, what if the object user does not need to
obtain this list? No matter, the AllTracks member variable will create 10,000 Song objects in memory:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// This caller does not care about getting all songs,</span>
    <span class="rem">// but indirectly created 10,000 objects!</span>
    MediaPlayer myPlayer = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MediaPlayer();
    myPlayer.Play();

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Clearly, you would rather not create 10,000 objects that nobody will use, as that will add a good deal
of stress to the .NET garbage collector. While you could manually add some code to ensure the allSongs
object is only created if used (perhaps using the factory method design pattern), there is an easier way.</p>
<p>With the release of .NET 4.0, the base class libraries provide a very interesting generic class named
Lazy&lt;&gt;, defined in the System namespace of mscorlib.dll. This class allows you to define data that will
not be created unless your code base actually makes use of it. As this is a generic class, you must specify
the type of item to be created on first use, which can be any type with the .NET base class libraries or a
custom type you have authored yourself. To enable lazy instantiation of the AllTracks member variable,
you can simply replace this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The MediaPlayer has-a AllTracks object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MediaPlayer
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> AllTracks allSongs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AllTracks();

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> AllTracks GetAllTracks()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Return all of the songs.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> allSongs;
    }
}</pre>
<p>with this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The MediaPlayer has-a Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt; object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MediaPlayer
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt; allSongs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt;();

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> AllTracks GetAllTracks()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Return all of the songs.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> allSongs.Value;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Beyond the fact that we are now representing the AllTracks member variable as a Lazy&lt;&gt; type,
notice that the implementation of the previous GetAllTracks() method has also been updated.
Specifically, we must make use of the read-only Value property of the Lazy&lt;&gt; class to obtain the actual
stored data (in this case, the AllTracks object that is maintaining the 10,000 Song objects).</p>
<p>With this simple update, notice how the following updated Main() method will indirectly allocate
the Song objects only if GetAllTracks() is indeed called:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Lazy Instantiation *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// No allocation of AllTracks object here!</span>
    MediaPlayer myPlayer = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MediaPlayer();
    myPlayer.Play();
    
    <span class="rem">// Allocation of AllTracks happens when you call GetAllTracks().</span>
    MediaPlayer yourPlayer = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MediaPlayer();
    AllTracks yourMusic = yourPlayer.GetAllTracks();

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Customizing the Creation of the Lazy Data</h2>
<p>When you declare a Lazy&lt;&gt; variable, the actual internal data type is created using the default
constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Default constructor of AllTracks is called when the Lazy&lt;&gt;</span>
<span class="rem">// variable is used.</span>
<span class="kwrd">private</span> Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt; allSongs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt;();</pre>
<p>While this might be fine in some cases, what if the AllTracks class had some additional
constructors, and you want to ensure the correct one is called? Furthermore, what if you have some extra
work do to (beyond simply creating the AllTracks object) when the Lazy&lt;&gt; variable is made? As luck
would have it, the Lazy&lt;&gt; class allows you to specify a generic delegate as an optional parameter, which
will specify a method to call during the creation of the wrapped type.</p>
<p>The generic delegate in question is of type System.Func&lt;&gt;, which can point to a method that returns
the same data type being created by the related Lazy&lt;&gt; variable and can take up to 16 arguments (which
are typed using generic type parameters). In most cases, you will not need to specify any parameters to
pass to the method pointed to by Func&lt;&gt;. Furthermore, to greatly simplify the use of the required Func&lt;&gt;,
I’d recommend using a lambda expression (see Chapter 11 for details regarding the delegate/lambda
relationship).</p>
<p>With this in mind, here is a final version of MediaPlayer that adds a bit of custom code when the
wrapped AllTracks object is created. Remember, this method must return a new instance of the type
wrapped by Lazy&lt;&gt; before exiting, and you can use any constructor you choose (here, we are still
invoking the default constructor of AllTracks):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MediaPlayer
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Use a lambda expression to add additional code</span>
    <span class="rem">// when the AllTracks object is made.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt; allSongs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Lazy&lt;AllTracks&gt;( () =&gt;
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Creating AllTracks object!"</span>);
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> AllTracks();
        }
    );

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> AllTracks GetAllTracks()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Return all of the songs.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> allSongs.Value;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Sweet! Hopefully you can see the usefulness of the Lazy&lt;&gt; class. Essentially, this new generic class
allows you to ensure expensive objects are only allocated when the object user requires them. If you find
this topic useful for your projects, you may also want to look up the System.Lazy&lt;&gt; class in the .NET
Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for further examples of how to program for "lazy instantiation".</p>
