<h1>Understanding WPF's Graphical Rendering Services</h1>
    <p>WPF uses a particular flavor of graphical rendering that goes by the term retained-mode graphics. Simply
put, this means that as you are using XAML or procedural code to generate graphical renderings, it is the
responsibility of WPF to persist these visual items and ensure they are correctly redrawn and refreshed
in an optimal manner. Thus, when you render graphical data, it is always present, even when the end
user hides the image by resizing or minimizing the window, by covering the window with another, and
so forth.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, previous Microsoft graphical rendering APIs (including Windows Form’s GDI+)
were immediate-mode graphical systems. In this model, it was up to the programmer to ensure that
rendered visuals were correctly “remembered” and updated during the life of the application. For
example, in a Windows Forms application, rendering a shape such as a rectangle involves handling the
Paint event (or overriding the virtual OnPaint() method), obtaining a Graphics object to draw the
rectangle and, most important, adding the infrastructure to ensure that the image was persisted when
the user resized the window (for example, creating member variables to represent the position of the
rectangle and calling Invalidate() throughout your program).</p>
<p>The shift from immediate-mode to retained-mode graphics is indeed a good thing, as programmers
have far less grungy graphics code to author and maintain. However, I’m not suggesting that the WPF
graphics API is completely different from earlier rendering toolkits. For example, like GDI+, WPF
supports various brush types and pen objects, techniques for hit-testing, clipping regions, graphical
transformations, and so on. So, if you currently have a background in GDI+ (or C/C++-based GDI), you
already know a good deal about how to perform basic renderings under WPF.</p>
<h2>WPF Graphical Rendering Options</h2>
<p>As with other aspects of WPF development, you have a number of choices regarding how to perform
your graphical rendering, beyond the decision to do so via XAML or procedural C# code (or perhaps a
combination of both). Specifically, WPF provides three distinct ways to render graphical data:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Shapes:</b> WPF provides the System.Windows.Shapes namespace, which defines a
        small number of classes for rendering 2D geometric objects (rectangles, ellipses,
        polygons, etc.). While these types are very simple to use, and very powerful, they
        do come with a fair amount of memory overhead if used with reckless abandon.</li>
 <li><b>Drawings and Geometries:</b> The WPF API provides a second way to render
        graphical data, using descendants from the System.Windows.Media.Drawing
        abstract class. Using classes such as GeometryDrawing or ImageDrawing (in addition
        to various geometry objects) you can render graphical data in a more lightweight
        (but less feature-rich) manner.</li>
 <li><p><b>Visuals:</b> The fastest and most lightweight way to render graphical data under WPF
        is using the visual layer, which is accessible only through C# code. Using
        descendants of System.Windows.Media.Visual, you can speak directly to the WPF
        graphical subsystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for offering different ways to do the exact same thing (i.e., render graphical data) has to
do with memory use and ultimately application performance. Because WPF is such a graphically
intensive system, it is not unreasonable for an application to render hundreds or even thousands of
different images on a window’s surface, and the choice of implementation (shapes, drawings, or visuals)
could have a huge impact.</p>
<p>Do understand that when you build a WPF application, chances are good you’ll use all three
options. As a rule of thumb, if you need a modest amount of interactive graphical data that can be
manipulated by the user (receive mouse input, display tooltips, etc), you’ll want to use members in the
System.Windows.Shapes namespace.</p>
<p>In contrast, drawings and geometries are more appropriate when you need to model complex,
generally non-interactive, vector-based graphical data using XAML or C#. While drawings and
geometries can still respond to mouse events, hit-testing, and drag-and-drop operations, you will
typically need to author more code to do so.</p>
<p>Last but not least, if you require the fastest possible way to render massive amounts of graphical
data, the visual layer is the way to go. For example, let’s say you are using WPF to build a scientific
application that can plot out thousands of points of data. Using the visual layer, you can render the plot
points in the most optimal way possible. As you will see later in this chapter, the visual layer is only
accessible via C# code, and is not XAML-friendly.</p>
<p>No matter which approach you take (shapes, drawings and geometries, or visuals) you will make use
of common graphical primitives such as brushes (which fill interiors), pens (which draw exteriors) and
transformation objects (which, well, transform the data). To begin the journey, we will begin working
with the classes of System.Windows.Shapes.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> WPF also ships with a full-blown API that can be used to render and manipulate 3D graphics, which is not
addressed in this edition of the text. Please consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation if you are
interested in incorporating 3D graphics in your applications.</p>
