<h1>The Asynchronous Nature of Delegates</h1>
<p>If you are new to the topic of multithreading, you may wonder what exactly an asynchronous method
invocation is all about. As you are no doubt fully aware, some programming operations take time.
Although the previous Add() was purely illustrative in nature, imagine that you built a single-threaded
application that is invoking a method on a remote object, performing a long-running database query,
downloading a large document, or writing 500 lines of text to an external file. While performing these
operations, the application will appear to hang for some amount of time. Until the task at hand has been
processed, all other aspects of this program (such as menu activation, toolbar clicking, or console
output) are unresponsive.</p>
<p>The question therefore is, how can you tell a delegate to invoke a method on a separate thread of
execution to simulate numerous tasks performing “at the same time”? The good news is that every .NET
delegate type is automatically equipped with this capability. The even better news is that you are not
required to directly dive into the details of the System.Threading namespace to do so (although these
entities can quite naturally work hand in hand).</p>
<h2>The BeginInvoke() and EndInvoke() Methods</h2>
<p>When the C# compiler processes the delegate keyword, the dynamically generated class defines two
methods named BeginInvoke() and EndInvoke(). Given the definition of the BinaryOp delegate, these
methods are prototyped as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BinaryOp : System.MulticastDelegate
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Used to invoke a method asynchronously.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> IAsyncResult BeginInvoke(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y,
        AsyncCallback cb, <span class="kwrd">object</span> state);

    <span class="rem">// Used to fetch the return value</span>
    <span class="rem">// of the invoked method.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> EndInvoke(IAsyncResult result);
}</pre>
<p>The first stack of parameters passed into BeginInvoke() will be based on the format of the C#
delegate (two integers in the case of BinaryOp). The final two arguments will always be
System.AsyncCallback and System.Object. You’ll examine the role of these parameters shortly; for the
time being, though, I’ll supply null for each. Also note that the return value of EndInvoke() is an integer,
based on the return type of BinaryOp, while the parameter of this method is of type IAsyncResult.</p>
<h2>The System.IAsyncResult Interface</h2>
<p>The BeginInvoke() method always returns an object implementing the IAsyncResult interface, while
EndInvoke() requires an IAsyncResult-compatible type as its sole parameter. The IAsyncResultcompatible
object returned from BeginInvoke() is basically a coupling mechanism that allows the
calling thread to obtain the result of the asynchronous method invocation at a later time via
EndInvoke(). The IAsyncResult interface (defined in the System namespace) is defined as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IAsyncResult
{
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> AsyncState { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    WaitHandle AsyncWaitHandle { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> CompletedSynchronously { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsCompleted { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>In the simplest case, you are able to avoid directly invoking these members. All you have to do is
cache the IAsyncResult-compatible object returned by BeginInvoke() and pass it to EndInvoke() when
you are ready to obtain the result of the method invocation. As you will see, you are able to invoke the
members of an IAsyncResult-compatible object when you wish to become “more involved” with the
process of fetching the method’s return value.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you asynchronously invoke a method that provides a void return value, you can simply “fire and
forget.” In such cases, you will never need to cache the IAsyncResult compatible object or call EndInvoke()
in the first place (as there is no return value to retrieve).</p>
