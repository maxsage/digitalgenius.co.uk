<h1>Hosting the WCF Service</h1>
<p>You are now ready to define a host. Although you would host a production-level service from a Windows
service or an IIS virtual directory, you will make your first host a simple console named
MagicEightBallServiceHost.</p>
<p>Once you create this new Console Application project, add a reference to the
System.ServiceModel.dlly and MagicEightBallServiceLib.dlly assemblies, and then update your initial
code file by importing the System.ServiceModel and MagicEightBallServiceLib namespaces:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.ServiceModel;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> MagicEightBallServiceLib;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MagicEightBallServiceHost
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Console Based WCF Host *****"</span>);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>The first step you must take when building a host for a WCF service type is to decide whether you
want to define the necessary hosting logic completely in code or to relegate several low-level details to
an application configuration file. As mentioned previously, the benefit of *.config files is that the host
can change the underlying plumbing without requiring you to recompile and redeploy the executable.
However, always remember this is strictly optional because you can hard-code the hosting logic using
the types within the System.ServiceModel.dll assembly.</p>
<p>This console-based host will use an application configuration file, so insert a new Application
Configuration File into your current project using the Project  Add New Item menu option.</p>
<h2>Establishing the ABCs Within an App.config File</h2>
<p>When you build a host for a WCF service type, you follow a predictable set of steps—some that rely on
configuration and some that rely on code:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Define the endpoint for the WCF service being hosted within the host’s
configuration file.</li>
  <li>Programmatically use the ServiceHost type to expose the service types available from this endpoint.</li>
  <li>Ensure the host remains running to service incoming client requests.
Obviously, this step is not required if you host your service types using a
Windows service or IIS.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the world of WCF, the term endpoint represents the address, binding, and contract rolled
together in a nice, tidy package. In XML, an endpoint is expressed using the &lt;endpoint&gt; element and the
address, binding, and contract elements. Update your *.config file to specify a single endpoint
(reachable through port 8080) exposed by this host:</p>

                <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">endpoint</span> <span class="attr">address</span> <span class="kwrd">="http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService"</span>
                    <span class="attr">binding</span><span class="kwrd">="basicHttpBinding"</span>
                    <span class="attr">contract</span><span class="kwrd">="MagicEightBallServiceLib.IEightBall"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
            <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">service</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">services</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">system.serviceModel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Notice that the &lt;system.serviceModel&gt; element is the root for all of a host’s WCF settings. Each
service exposed by the host is represented by a &lt;service&gt; element that is wrapped by the &lt;services&gt;
base element. Here, your single &lt;service&gt; element uses the (optional) name attribute to specify the
friendly name of the service type.</p>
<p>The nested &lt;endpoint&gt; element handles the task of defining the address, the binding model
(basicHttpBinding, in this example), and the fully qualified name of the interface type defining the WCF
service contract (IEightBall). Because you are using an HTTP-based binding, you use the http://
scheme, specifying an arbitrary port ID.</p>
<h2>Coding Against the ServiceHost Type</h2>
<p>With the current configuration file in place, the actual programming logic required to complete the host
is simple. When your executable starts up, you will create an instance of the ServiceHost class and
inform it which WCF service it is responsible for hosting. At runtime, this object will automatically read
the data within the scope of the &lt;system.serviceModel&gt; element of the host’s *.config file to determine
the correct address, binding, and contract. It will then create the necessary plumbing:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Console Based WCF Host *****"</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (ServiceHost serviceHost = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ServiceHost(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(MagicEightBallService)))
    {
        <span class="rem">// Open the host and start listening for incoming messages.</span>
        serviceHost.Open();

        <span class="rem">// Keep the service running until the Enter key is pressed.</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The service is ready."</span>);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Press the Enter key to terminate service."</span>);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you run this application now, you will find that the host is alive in memory, ready to take
incoming requests from remote clients.</p>
<h2>Specifying Base Addresses</h2>
<p>Currently, you create your ServiceHost using a constructor that requires only the service’s type
information. However, it is also possible to pass in an array of System.Uri types as a constructor
argument to represent the collection of addresses this service is accessible from. Currently, you find the
address using the *.config file. However, assume that you were to update the using scope like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (ServiceHost serviceHost = <span class="kwrd">new</span>
    ServiceHost(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(MagicEightBallService),
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri[]{<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService"</span>)}))
{
...
}</pre>
<p>If you did, you could now define your endpoint like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">endpoint</span> <span class="attr">address</span> <span class="kwrd">=""</span>
    <span class="attr">binding</span><span class="kwrd">="basicHttpBinding"</span>
    <span class="attr">contract</span><span class="kwrd">="MagicEightBallServiceLib.IEightBall"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
 <p>Of course, too much hard-coding within a host’s code base decreases flexibility. Therefore, the
current host example assumes you create the service host simply by supplying the type information, as
you did before:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (ServiceHost serviceHost = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ServiceHost(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(MagicEightBallService)))
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>One of the (slightly frustrating) aspects of authoring host *.config files is that you have several ways
to construct the XML descriptors, based on the amount of hard-coding you have in the code base (as you
have just seen in the case of the optional Uri array). Here’s a reworking that shows yet another way to
author *.config files:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;?</span><span class="html">xml</span> <span class="attr">version</span><span class="kwrd">="1.0"</span> <span class="attr">encoding</span><span class="kwrd">="utf-8"</span> ?<span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">services</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

                <span class="rem">&lt;!-- Address obtained from &lt;baseAddresses&gt; --&gt;</span>
                <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">endpoint</span> <span class="attr">address</span> <span class="kwrd">=""</span>
                    <span class="attr">binding</span><span class="kwrd">="basicHttpBinding"</span>
                    <span class="attr">contract</span><span class="kwrd">="MagicEightBallServiceLib.IEightBall"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

                <span class="rem">&lt;!-- List all of the base addresses in a dedicated section--&gt;</span>
                <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">host</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
                    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">baseAddresses</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
                        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">baseAddress</span> <span class="kwrd">="http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
                    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">baseAddresses</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
                <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">host</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
            <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">service</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">services</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">system.serviceModel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>In this case, the address attribute of the &lt;endpoint&gt; element is still empty; regardless of the fact that
you do not specify an array of Uri objects in code when creating the ServiceHost, the application runs as
before because the value is pulled from the baseAddresses scope. The benefit of storing the base address
in a &lt;host&gt;’s &lt;baseAddresses&gt; region is that other parts of a *.config file (such as, which you’ll learn
about shortly) also need to know the address of the service’s endpoint. Thus, rather than having to copy
and pass address values within a single *.config file, you can isolate the single value, as shown in the
preceding snippet.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> In a later example, you’ll be introduced to a graphical configuration tool that allows you to author
configuration files in a less tedious manner.</p>
<p>In any case, you have a bit more work to do before you build a client application to communicate
with your service. Specifically, you will dig a bit deeper into the role of the ServiceHost class type and
&lt;service.serviceModel&gt; element, as well as the role of metadata exchange (MEX) services.</p>
<h2>Details of the ServiceHost Type</h2>
<p>You use the ServiceHost class type to configure and expose a WCF service from the hosting executable.
However, be aware that you will only use this type directly when building a custom *.exe to host your
services. If you use IIS (or the Vista and Windows 7 specific WAS) to expose a service, the ServiceHost
object is created automatically on your behalf.</p>
<p>As you have seen, this type requires a complete service description, which is obtained dynamically
through the configuration settings of the host’s *.config file. While this happens automatically when
you create a ServiceHost object, it is possible to configure the state of your ServiceHost object manually
using a number of members. In addition to Open() and Close() (which communicate with your service
in a synchronous manner), Table 25-8 illustrates some further members of interest.</p>

<p>You can see some additional aspects of ServiceHost in action by updating your Program class with a
new static method that prints out the ABCs of each endpoint used by the host:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayHostInfo(ServiceHost host)
{
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Host Info *****"</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint se
        <span class="kwrd">in</span> host.Description.Endpoints)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Address: {0}"</span>, se.Address);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Binding: {0}"</span>, se.Binding.Name);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Contract: {0}"</span>, se.Contract.Name);
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"**********************"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>Now assuming that you call this new method from within Main() after opening your host:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (ServiceHost serviceHost = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ServiceHost(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(MagicEightBallService)))
{
    <span class="rem">// Open the host and start listening for incoming messages.</span>
    serviceHost.Open();
    DisplayHostInfo(serviceHost);
...
}</pre>
<p>Doing this will generate the statistics shown in the following output:</p>

<h2>Enabling Metadata Exchange</h2>
<p>Recall that WCF client applications communicate with the WCF service through an intervening proxy
type. While you could author the proxy code completely by hand, doing so would be tedious and errorprone.
Ideally, you could use a tool to generate the necessary grunge code (including the client-side
*.config file). Thankfully, the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK provides a command-line tool (svcutil.exe) for
this purpose. Also, Visual Studio 2010 provides similar functionality through its Project ? Add Service
Reference menu option.</p>
<p>For these tools to generate the necessary proxy code/*.config file, however, they must be able to
discover the format of the WCF service interfaces and any defined data contracts (e.g., the method
names and type of parameters).</p>
<p>Metadata exchange (MEX) is a WCF service behavior that you can use to fine-tune how the WCF
runtime handles your service. Simply put, each &lt;behavior&gt; element can define a set of activities a given
service can subscribe to. WCF provides numerous behaviors out of the box, and it is possible to build
your own.</p>
<p>The MEX behavior (which is disabled by default) will intercept any metadata requests sent through
HTTP GET. You must enable MEX if you want to allow svcutil.exe or Visual Studio 2010 to automate the
creation of the required client-side proxy *.config file.</p>
<p>Enabling MEX is a matter of tweaking the host’s *.config file with the proper settings (or authoring
the corresponding C# code). First, you must add a new &lt;endpoint&gt; just for MEX. Second, you need to
define a WCF behavior to allow HTTP GET access. Third, you need to associate this behavior by name to
your service using the behaviorConfiguration attribute on the opening &lt;service&gt; element. Finally, you
need to add a &lt;host&gt; element to define the base address of this service (MEX will look here to figure out
the locations of the types to describe).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You can bypass this final step if you pass in a System.Uri object to represent the base address as a
parameter to the ServiceHost constructor.</p>
<p>Consider the following updated host *.config file, which creates a custom &lt;behavior&gt; element
(named EightBallServiceMEXBehavior) that is associated to your service through the
behaviorConfiguration attribute within the &lt;service&gt; definition:</p>

<p>You can now restart the service and view its metadata description using the web browser of your
choice. To do so, enter the address as the URL while the host is still running:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService</pre>
<p>Once you are at the homepage for your WCF service (see Figure 25-6), you are provided with basic
details regarding how to interact with this service programmatically, as well as a way to view the WSDL
contract by clicking the hyperlink at the top of the page. Recall that Web Service Description Language
(WSDL) is a grammar that describes the structure of web services at a given endpoint.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure25_06.png" alt="Figure 25-6" />
<p><b>Figure 25-6</b> Ready to view metadata using MEX</p>
<p>Your host now exposes two different endpoints (one for the service and one for MEX), so your host’s
console output will appear like this:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
***** Console Based WCF Host *****

***** Host Info *****
Address: http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService
Binding: BasicHttpBinding
Contract: IEightBall

Address: http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService/mex
Binding: MetadataExchangeHttpBinding
Contract: IMetadataExchange
**********************

The service is ready.
