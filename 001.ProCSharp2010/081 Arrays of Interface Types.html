<h1>Arrays of Interface Types</h1>
  <p>Recall that the same interface can be implemented by numerous types, even if they are not within the
same class hierarchy and do not have a common parent class beyond System.Object. This can yield
some very powerful programming constructs. For example, assume you have developed three new class
types within your current project that model kitchen utensils (via Knife and Fork classes) and another
modeling gardening equipment (à la PitchFork). Consider Figure 9-4.</p>

<p><b>Figure 9-4.</b> Recall that interfaces can be “plugged into” any type in any part of a class hierarchy</p>
<p>If you defined the PitchFork, Fork, and Knife types, you could now define an array of IPointycompatible
objects. Given that these members all support the same interface, you can iterate through
the array and treat each item as an IPointy-compatible object, regardless of the overall diversity of the
class hierarchies:</p>

...
    <span class="rem">// This array can only contain types that</span>
    <span class="rem">// implement the IPointy interface.</span>
    IPointy[] myPointyObjects = {<span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon(), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Knife(),
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> Triangle(), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Fork(), <span class="kwrd">new</span> PitchFork()};

    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(IPointy i <span class="kwrd">in</span> myPointyObjects)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Object has {0} points."</span>, i.Points);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
