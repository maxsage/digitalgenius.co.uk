<h1>Working with DataRows</h1>
<p>As you have seen, a collection of DataColumn objects represents the schema of a DataTable. In contrast, a
collection of DataRow objects represents the actual data in the table. Thus, if you have 20 rows in the
Inventory table of the AutoLot database, you can represent these records using 20 DataRow objects.
Table 22-4 documents some (but not all) of the members of the DataRow type.</p>
<p><b>Table 22-4.</b> Key Members of the DataRow Type</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Members
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    HasErrors GetColumnsInError() GetColumnError() ClearErrors() RowError
   </td>
   <td>
    The HasErrors property returns a Boolean value indicating whether there
are errors in a DataRow. If so, you can use the GetColumnsInError() method
to obtain the offending columns and GetColumnError()to obtain the error
description. Similarly, you can use the ClearErrors() method to remove
each error listing for the row. The RowError property allows you to
configure a textual description of the error for a given row.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ItemArray
   </td>
   <td>
    This property gets or sets all of the column values for this row using an
array of objects.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    RowState
   </td>
   <td>
    You use this property to pinpoint the current state of the DataRow in the
DataTable containing the DataRow, using values of the RowState
enumeration (e.g., a row can be flagged as new, modified, unchanged, or
deleted).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Table
   </td>
   <td>
    You use this property to obtain a reference to the DataTable containing
this DataRow.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AcceptChanges() RejectChanges()
   </td>
   <td>
    These methods commit or reject all changes made to this row since the
last time AcceptChanges() was called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    BeginEdit() EndEdit() CancelEdit()
   </td>
   <td>
    These methods begin, end, or cancel an edit operation on a DataRow
object.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Delete()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method marks a row you want to remove when the AcceptChanges()
method is called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsNull()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method gets a value indicating whether the specified column
contains a null value.
   </td>
  </tr>

<p>Working with a DataRow is a bit different from working with a DataColumn; you cannot create a direct
instance of this type because there is no public constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! No public constructor!</span>
DataRow r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataRow();</pre>
<p>Instead, you obtain a new DataRow object from a given DataTable. For example, assume you wish to
insert two rows in the Inventory table. The DataTable.NewRow() method allows you to obtain the next
slot in the table, at which point you can fill each column with new data using the type indexer. When
doing so, you can specify either the string name assigned to the DataColumn or its (zero-based) ordinal
position:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> FillDataSet(DataSet ds)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Now add some rows to the Inventory Table.</span>
    DataRow carRow = inventoryTable.NewRow();
    carRow[<span class="str">"Make"</span>] = <span class="str">"BMW"</span>;
    carRow[<span class="str">"Color"</span>] = <span class="str">"Black"</span>;
    carRow[<span class="str">"PetName"</span>] = <span class="str">"Hamlet"</span>;
    inventoryTable.Rows.Add(carRow);

    carRow = inventoryTable.NewRow();
    <span class="rem">// Column 0 is the autoincremented ID field,</span>
    <span class="rem">// so start at 1.</span>
    carRow[1] = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>;
    carRow[2] = <span class="str">"Red"</span>;
    carRow[3] = <span class="str">"Sea Breeze"</span>;
    inventoryTable.Rows.Add(carRow);
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> If you pass the DataRow’s indexer method an invalid column name or ordinal position, you will receive a
runtime exception.</p>
<p>At this point, you have a single DataTable containing two rows. Of course, you can repeat this
general process to create a number of DataTables to define the schema and data content. Before you
insert the inventoryTable object into your DataSet object, you should check out the all-important
RowState property.</p>
<h2>Understanding the RowState Property</h2>
<p>The RowState property is useful when you need to identify programmatically the set of all rows in a table
that have changed from their original value, have been newly inserted, and so forth. You can assign this
property any value from the DataRowState enumeration, as shown in Table 22-5.</p>
<p><b>Table 22-5.</b> Values of the DataRowState Enumeration</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Value
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Added
   </td>
   <td>
    The row has been added to a DataRowCollection, and AcceptChanges() has not
been called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Deleted
   </td>
   <td>
    The row has been marked for deletion using the Delete() method of the DataRow,
and AcceptChanges() has not been called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Detached
   </td>
   <td>
    The row has been created but is not part of any DataRowCollection. A DataRow is in
this state immediately after it has been created, but before it is added to a
collection. It is also in this state if it has been removed from a collection.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Modified
   </td>
   <td>
    The row has been modified, and AcceptChanges() has not been called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Unchanged
   </td>
   <td>
    The row has not changed since AcceptChanges() was last called.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>When you manipulate the rows of a given DataTable programmatically, the RowState property is set
automatically. For example, add a new method to your Program class, which operates on a local DataRow
object, printing out its row state along the way:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ManipulateDataRowState()
{
    <span class="rem">// Create a temp DataTable for testing.</span>
    DataTable temp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataTable(<span class="str">"Temp"</span>);
    temp.Columns.Add(<span class="kwrd">new</span> DataColumn(<span class="str">"TempColumn"</span>, <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span>)));
    
    <span class="rem">// RowState = Detached (i.e. not part of a DataTable yet)</span>
    DataRow row = temp.NewRow();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After calling NewRow(): {0}"</span>, row.RowState);
    
    <span class="rem">// RowState = Added.</span>
    temp.Rows.Add(row);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After calling Rows.Add(): {0}"</span>, row.RowState);
    
    <span class="rem">// RowState = Added.</span>
    row[<span class="str">"TempColumn"</span>] = 10;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After first assignment: {0}"</span>, row.RowState);
    
    <span class="rem">// RowState = Unchanged.</span>
    temp.AcceptChanges();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After calling AcceptChanges: {0}"</span>, row.RowState);
    
    <span class="rem">// RowState = Modified.</span>
    row[<span class="str">"TempColumn"</span>] = 11;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After first assignment: {0}"</span>, row.RowState);
    
    <span class="rem">// RowState = Deleted.</span>
    temp.Rows[0].Delete();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After calling Delete: {0}"</span>, row.RowState);
}</pre>
<p>The ADO.NET DataRow is smart enough to remember its current state of affairs. Given this, the
owning DataTable is able to identify which rows have been added, updated, or deleted. This is a key
feature of the DataSet because, when it comes time to send updated information to the data store, only
the modified data is submitted.</p>
<h2>Understanding the DataRowVersion Property</h2>
<p>Beyond maintaining the current state of a row with the RowState property, a DataRow object maintains
three possible versions of the data it contains using the DataRowVersion property. When a DataRow object
is first constructed, it contains only a single copy of data, represented as the current version. However, as
you programmatically manipulate a DataRow object (using various method calls), additional versions of
the data spring to life. Specifically, you can set the DataRowVersion to any value of the related
DataRowVersion enumeration (see Table 22-6).</p>
<p><b>Table 22-6.</b> Values of the DataRowVersion Enumeration</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Value
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Current
   </td>
   <td>
    This represents the current value of a row, even after changes have been made.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Default
   </td>
   <td>
    This is the default version of DataRowState. For a DataRowState value of Added,
Modified, or Deleted, the default version is Current. For a DataRowState value of
Detached, the version is Proposed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Original
   </td>
   <td>
    This represents the value first inserted into a DataRow or the value the last time
AcceptChanges() was called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Proposed
   </td>
   <td>
    This is the value of a row currently being edited due to a call to BeginEdit().
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As suggested in Table 22-6, the value of the DataRowVersion property is dependent on the value of
the DataRowState property in many cases. As mentioned previously, the DataRowVersion property will be
changed behind the scenes when you invoke various methods on the DataRow (or, in some cases, the
DataTable) object. Here is a breakdown of the methods that can affect the value of a row’s
DataRowVersion property:</p>
<ul>
 <li>If you call the DataRow.BeginEdit() method and change the row’s value, the
Current and Proposed values become available.</li>
 <li>If you call the DataRow.CancelEdit() method, the Proposed value is deleted.</li>
 <li>After you call DataRow.EndEdit(), the Proposed value becomes the Current value.</li>
 <li>After you call the DataRow.AcceptChanges() method, the Original value becomes
identical to the Current value. The same transformation occurs when you call
DataTable.AcceptChanges().</li>
 <li>After you call DataRow.RejectChanges(), the Proposed value is discarded, and the
version becomes Current.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is a bit convoluted, not least because a DataRow might or might not have all versions at any
given time (you’ll receive runtime exceptions if you attempt to obtain a row version that is not currently
tracked). Regardless of the complexity, given that the DataRow maintains three copies of data, it becomes
simple to build a front end that allows an end user to alter values, change his or her mind and roll back
values, or commit values permanently. You’ll see various examples of manipulating these methods over
the remainder of this chapter.</p>
