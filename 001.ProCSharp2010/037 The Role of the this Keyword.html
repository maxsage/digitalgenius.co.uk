    <h1>The Role of the this Keyword</h1>
    <p>C# supplies a this keyword that provides access to the current class instance. One possible use of the this 
    keyword is to resolve scope ambiguity, which can arise when an incoming parameter is named identically to a data 
    field of the type. Of course, ideally you would simply adopt a naming convention that does not result in such 
    ambiguity; however, to illustrate this use of the this keyword, update your Motorcycle class with a new string 
    field (named name) to represent the driver's name. Next, add a method named SetDriverName() implemented as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;

    <span class="rem">// New members to represent the name of the driver.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> name;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetDriverName(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
    { name = name; }
...
}</pre>
    <p>Although this code will compile just fine, Visual Studio 2010 will display a warning message informing you that you 
    have assigned a variable back to itself! To illustrate, update Main() to call SetDriverName() and then print out the 
    value of the name field, you may be surprised to find that the value of the name field is an empty string!</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Make a Motorcycle with a rider named Tiny?</span>
Motorcycle c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Motorcycle(5);
c.SetDriverName(<span class="str">"Tiny"</span>);
c.PopAWheely();
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Rider name is {0}"</span>, c.name); <span class="rem">// Prints an empty name value!</span></pre>
    <p>The problem is that the implementation of SetDriverName() is assigning the incoming parameter back to itself 
    given that the compiler assumes name is referring to the variable currently in the method scope rather than the name 
    field at the class scope. To inform the compiler that you wish to set the current object's name data field to the 
    incoming name parameter, simply use this to resolve the ambiguity:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetDriverName(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
{ <span class="kwrd">this</span>.name = name; }    </pre>
    <p>Do understand that if there is no ambiguity, you are not required to make use of the this keyword when a class 
    wishes to access its own data fields or members, as this is implied. For example, if we rename the string data member 
    from name to driverName (which will also require you to update your Main() method) the use of this is optional as
    there is no longer a scope ambiguity:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> driverName;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetDriverName(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
    {
        <span class="rem">// These two statements are functionally the same.</span>
        driverName = name;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.driverName = name;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>Even though there is little to be gained when using this in unambiguous situations, you may still find this keyword 
    useful when implementing class members, as IDEs such as SharpDevelop and Visual Studio 2010 will enable IntelliSense 
    when this is specified. This can be very helpful when you have forgotten the name of a class member and want to quickly 
    recall the definition. Consider Figure 5-2.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure05_02.png" alt="Figure 5-2" />           
    <p><b>Figure 5-2.</b> The IntelliSense of this</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> It is a compiler error to use the this keyword within the implementation of a static member. As you 
    will see, static members operate on the class (not object) level, and therefore at the class level, there is no 
    current object (thus no this)!</p>
    <h2>Chaining Constructor Calls Using this</h2>
    <p>Another use of the this keyword is to design a class using a technique termed constructor chaining. This design 
    pattern is helpful when you have a class that defines multiple constructors. Given the fact that constructors often 
    validate the incoming arguments to enforce various business rules, it can be quite common to find redundant validation 
    logic within a class's constructor set. Consider the following updated Motorcycle:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> driverName;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle() { }

    <span class="rem">// Redundent constructor logic!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (intensity &gt; 10)
        {
            intensity = 10;
        }
        driverIntensity = intensity;
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity, <span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (intensity &gt; 10)
        {
            intensity = 10;
        }
    
        driverIntensity = intensity;
        driverName = name;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>Here, perhaps in an attempt to ensure the safety of the rider, each constructor is ensuring that the intensity 
    level is never greater than 10. While this is all well and good, you do have redundant code statements in two 
    constructors. This is less than ideal, as you are now required to update code in multiple locations if your rules 
    change (for example, if the intensity should not be greater than 5).</p>
    <p>One way to improve the current situation is to define a method in the Motorcycle class that will validate the 
    incoming argument(s). If you were to do so, each constructor could make a call to this method before making the
    field assignment(s). While this approach does allow you to isolate the code you need to update when the business 
    rules change, you are now dealing with the following redundancy:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> driverName;

    <span class="rem">// Constructors.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle() { }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity)
    {
        SetIntensity(intensity);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity, <span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
    {
        SetIntensity(intensity);
        driverName = name;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetIntensity(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (intensity &gt; 10)
        {
            intensity = 10;
        }
    
        driverIntensity = intensity;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>A cleaner approach is to designate the constructor that takes the greatest number of arguments as the 
    "master constructor" and have its implementation perform the required validation logic. The remaining constructors 
    can make use of the this keyword to forward the incoming arguments to the master constructor and provide any 
    additional parameters as necessary. In this way, you only need to worry about maintaining a single constructor 
    for the entire class, while the remaining constructors are basically empty.</p>
    <p>Here is the final iteration of the Motorcycle class (with one additional constructor for the sake of 
    llustration). When chaining constructors, note how the this keyword is "dangling" off the constructor's declaration 
    (via a colon operator) outside the scope of the constructor itself:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> driverName;

    <span class="rem">// Constructor chaining.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle() {}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity)
        : <span class="kwrd">this</span>(intensity, <span class="str">""</span>) {}
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
        : <span class="kwrd">this</span>(0, name) {}

    <span class="rem">// This is the 'master' constructor that does all the real work.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity, <span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (intensity &gt; 10)
        {
            intensity = 10;
        }
        driverIntensity = intensity;
        driverName = name;
    }
    ...
}</pre>
    <p>Understand that using the this keyword to chain constructor calls is never mandatory. However, when you make use 
    of this technique, you do tend to end up with a more maintainable and concise class definition. Again, using this 
    technique you can simplify your programming tasks, as the real work is delegated to a single constructor (typically 
    the constructor that has the most parameters), while the other constructors simply "pass the buck."</p>
    <h2>Observing Constructor Flow</h2>
    <p>On a final note, do know that once a constructor passes arguments to the designated master constructor
    (and that constructor has processed the data), the constructor invoked originally by the caller will finish
    executing any remaining code statements. To clarify, update each of the constructors of the Motorcycle
    class with a fitting call to Console.WriteLine():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> driverName;

    <span class="rem">// Constructor chaining.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"In default ctor"</span>);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity)
        : <span class="kwrd">this</span>(intensity, <span class="str">""</span>)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"In ctor taking an int"</span>);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
        : <span class="kwrd">this</span>(0, name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"In ctor taking a string"</span>);
    }

    <span class="rem">// This is the 'master' constructor that does all the real work.</span>

        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (intensity &gt; 10)
        {
            intensity = 10;
        }
        driverIntensity = intensity;
        driverName = name;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>Now, ensure your Main() method exercises a Motorcycle object as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with class Types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make a Motorcycle.</span>
    Motorcycle c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Motorcycle(5);
    c.SetDriverName(<span class="str">"Tiny"</span>);
    c.PopAWheely();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Rider name is {0}"</span>, c.driverName);
    Console.ReadLine();
} </pre>   
    <p>With this, ponder the output from the previous Main() method:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with class Types *****

Yeeeeeee Haaaaaeewww!
Yeeeeeee Haaaaaeewww!

</pre>
    <p>As you can see, the flow of constructor logic is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You create your object by invoking the constructor requiring a single int.</li>
        <li>This constructor forwards the supplied data to the master constructor and
        provides any additional startup arguments not specified by the caller.</li>
        <li>
        The master constructor assigns the incoming data to the object's field data.</li>
        <li>Control is returned to the constructor originally called, and executes any
        remaining code statements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The nice thing about using constructor chaining, is that this programming pattern will work with
    any version of the C# language and .NET platform. However, if you are targeting .NET 4.0 and higher,
    you can further simplify your programming tasks by making use of optional arguments as an alternative
    to traditional constructor chaining.</p>
    <h2>Revisiting Optional Arguments</h2>
    <p>In Chapter 4, you learned about optional and named arguments. Recall that optional arguments allow
    you to define supplied default values to incoming arguments. If the caller is happy with these defaults,
    they are not required to specify a unique value, however they may do so to provide the object with
    custom data. Consider the following version of Motorcycle which now provides a number of ways to
    construct objects using a single constructor definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="rem">// Single constructor using optional args.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity = 0, <span class="kwrd">string</span> name = <span class="str">""</span>)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (intensity &gt; 10)
        {
            intensity = 10;
        }
        driverIntensity = intensity;
        driverName = name;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>With this one constructor, you are now able to create a new Motorcycle object using zero, one, or
    two arguments. Recall that named argument syntax allows you to essentially skip over acceptable default
    settings (see Chapter 3).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MakeSomeBikes()
{
    <span class="rem">// driverName = "", driverIntensity = 0</span>
    Motorcycle m1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Motorcycle();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Name= {0}, Intensity= {1}"</span>,
        m1.driverName, m1.driverIntensity);

    <span class="rem">// driverName = "Tiny", driverIntensity = 0</span>
    Motorcycle m2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Motorcycle(name:<span class="str">"Tiny"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Name= {0}, Intensity= {1}"</span>,
        m2.driverName, m2.driverIntensity);

    <span class="rem">// driverName = "", driverIntensity = 7</span>
    Motorcycle m3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Motorcycle(7);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Name= {0}, Intensity= {1}"</span>,
    m3.driverName, m3.driverIntensity);
}</pre>
    <p>While the use of optional/named arguments is a very slick way to streamline how you define the set
    of constructors used by a given class, do always remember that this syntax will lock you into compiling
    your software under C# 2010 and running your code under .NET 4.0. If you need to build classes which
    can run under any version of the .NET platform, it is best to stick to classical constructor chaining
    techniques.</p>
    <p>In any case, at this point you are able to define a class with field data (aka member variables) and
    various members such as methods and constructors. Next up, let's formalize the role of the static
    keyword.</p>
