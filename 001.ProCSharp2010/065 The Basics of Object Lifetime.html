<h1>The Basics of Object Lifetime</h1>
   <p>When you are building your C# applications, you are correct to assume that the .NET runtime
environment will take care of the managed heap without your direct intervention. In fact, the golden
rule of .NET memory management is simple:</p>
<p><b>Rule</b> Allocate a class instance onto the managed heap using the new keyword and forget about it.</p>
<p>Once instantiated, the garbage collector will destroy an object when it is no longer needed. The next
obvious question, of course, is, “How does the garbage collector determine when an object is no longer
needed?” The short (i.e., incomplete) answer is that the garbage collector removes an object from the
heap when it is unreachable by any part of your code base. Assume you have a method in your Program
class that allocates a local Car object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MakeACar()
{
    <span class="rem">// If myCar is the only reference to the Car object,</span>
    <span class="rem">// it *may* be destroyed when this method returns.</span>
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that this Car reference (myCar) has been created directly within the MakeACar() method and
has not been passed outside of the defining scope (via a return value or ref/out parameters). Thus, once
this method call completes, the myCar reference is no longer reachable, and the associated Car object is
now a candidate for garbage collection. Understand, however, that you can’t guarantee that this object
will be reclaimed from memory immediately after MakeACar() has completed. All you can assume at this
point is that when the CLR performs the next garbage collection, the myCar object could be safely
destroyed.</p>
<p>As you will most certainly discover, programming in a garbage-collected environment greatly
simplifies your application development. In stark contrast, C++ programmers are painfully aware that if
they fail to manually delete heap-allocated objects, memory leaks are never far behind. In fact, tracking
down memory leaks is one of the most time-consuming (and tedious) aspects of programming in
unmanaged environments. By allowing the garbage collector to take charge of destroying objects, the
burden of memory management has been lifted from your shoulders and placed onto those of the CLR.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you happen to have a background in COM development, note that .NET objects do not maintain an
internal reference counter, and therefore managed objects do not expose methods such as AddRef() or
Release().</p>
<h2>The CIL of new</h2>
<p>When the C# compiler encounters the new keyword, it emits a CIL newobj instruction into the method
implementation. If you compile the current example code and investigate the resulting assembly using
ildasm.exe, you’d find the following CIL statements within the MakeACar() method:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void MakeACar() cil managed
{
    // Code size 8 (0x8)
    .maxstack 1
    .locals init ([0] class SimpleGC.Car myCar)
    IL_0000: nop
    IL_0001: newobj instance void SimpleGC.Car::.ctor()
    IL_0006: stloc.0
    IL_0007: ret
} // end of method Program::MakeACar
</pre>
<p>Before we examine the exact rules that determine when an object is removed from the managed
heap, let’s check out the role of the CIL newobj instruction in a bit more detail. First, understand that the
managed heap is more than just a random chunk of memory accessed by the CLR. The .NET garbage
collector is quite a tidy housekeeper of the heap, given that it will compact empty blocks of memory
(when necessary) for purposes of optimization. To aid in this endeavor, the managed heap maintains a
pointer (commonly referred to as the next object pointer or new object pointer) that identifies exactly
where the next object will be located.</p>
<p>That said, the newobj instruction tells the CLR to perform the following core operations:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Calculate the total amount of memory required for the object to be allocated
(including the memory required by the data members and the base classes).
 </li>
 <li>
  Examine the managed heap to ensure that there is indeed enough room to host
the object to be allocated. If there is, the specified constructor is called and the
caller is ultimately returned a reference to the new object in memory, whose
address just happens to be identical to the last position of the next object pointer.
 </li>
 <li>
  Finally, before returning the reference to the caller, advance the next object
pointer to point to the next available slot on the managed heap.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The basic process is illustrated in Figure 8-2.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure08_02.png" alt="Figure 8-2" />
<p><b>Figure 8-2</b> The details of allocating objects onto the managed heap</p>
<p>As your application is busy allocating objects, the space on the managed heap may eventually
become full. When processing the newobj instruction, if the CLR determines that the managed heap does
not have sufficient memory to allocate the requested type, it will perform a garbage collection in an
attempt to free up memory. Thus, the next rule of garbage collection is also quite simple:</p>
<p><b>Rule</b> If the managed heap does not have sufficient memory to allocate a requested object, a garbage collection
will occur.</p>
<p>Exactly how this garbage collection occurs, however, depends on which version of the .NET
platform your application is running under. You’ll look at the differences a bit later in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Setting Object References to null</h2>
 <p>Those of you who created COM objects using Visual Basic 6.0 know that it was always preferable to set
their references to Nothing when you were finished using them. Under the covers, the reference count of
the COM object was decremented by one, and the object could be removed from memory if its reference
count equaled 0. In a similar fashion, C/C++ programmers often set pointer variables to null to ensure
they are no longer referencing unmanaged memory.</p>
<p>Given these facts, you might wonder what the end result is of assigning object references to null
under C#. For example, assume the MakeACar() subroutine has now been updated as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MakeACar()
{
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    myCar = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
}</pre>
<p>When you assign object references to null, the compiler generates CIL code that ensures the
reference (myCar in this example) no longer points to any object. If you once again made use of
ildasm.exe to view the CIL code of the modified MakeACar(), you would find the ldnull opcode (which
pushes a null value on the virtual execution stack) followed by a stloc.0 opcode (which sets the null
reference on the variable):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void MakeACar() cil managed
{
    // Code size 10 (0xa)
    .maxstack 1
    .locals init ([0] class SimpleGC.Car myCar)
    IL_0000: nop
    IL_0001: newobj instance void SimpleGC.Car::.ctor()
    IL_0006: stloc.0
    IL_0007: ldnull
    IL_0008: stloc.0
    IL_0009: ret
} // end of method Program::MakeACar</pre>
<p>What you must understand, however, is that assigning a reference to null does not in any way force
the garbage collector to fire up at that exact moment and remove the object from the heap. The only
thing you have accomplished is explicitly clipping the connection between the reference and the object
it previously pointed to. Given this point, setting references to null under C# is far less consequential
than doing so in other C-based languages (or VB 6.0); however, doing so will certainly not cause any
harm.</p>
