<h1>Building and Consuming a Multifile Assembly</h1>
    <p>Now that you have constructed and consumed a single-file assembly, let’s examine the process of
building a multifile assembly. Recall that a multifile assembly is simply a collection of related modules
that is deployed and versioned as a single logical unit. At the time of this writing, the Visual Studio IDE
does not support a C# multifile assembly project template. Therefore, you will need to make use of the
command-line compiler (csc.exe) to build such a beast.</p>
<p>To describe the process, you will build a multifile assembly named AirVehicles. The primary
module (airvehicles.dll) will contain a single class type named Helicopter. The related manifest (also
contained in airvehicles.dll) will catalog an additional *.netmodule file named ufo.netmodule that
contains another class type named (of course) Ufo. Although both class types are physically contained in
separate binaries, you will group them into a single namespace named AirVehicles. You’ll create both
classes using C# (although you could certainly mix and match languages if you desire).</p>
<p>To begin, open a simple text editor (such as Notepad) and create the following Ufo class definition
and save it to a file named ufo.cs:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> AirVehicles
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Ufo
    {
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AbductHuman()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Resistance is futile"</span>);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>To compile this class into a .NET module, open a Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt, navigate to
the folder containing ufo.cs and issue the following command to the C# compiler (the module option of
the /target flag instructs csc.exe to produce a *.netmodule as opposed to a *.dll or an *.exe file):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">csc.exe /t:module ufo.cs</pre>
<p>If you now look in the folder that contains the ufo.cs file, you should see a new file named
ufo.netmodule (take a peek in your working directory). Next, create a new file named helicopter.cs that
contains the following class definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> AirVehicles
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Helicopter
    {
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> TakeOff()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Helicopter taking off!"</span>);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Given that airvehicles.dll is the intended name of the primary module of this multifile assembly,
you will need to compile helicopter.cs using the /t:library and /out: options. To enlist the
ufo.netmodule binary into the assembly manifest, you must also specify the /addmodule flag. The
following command does the trick:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
csc /t:library /addmodule:ufo.netmodule /<span class="kwrd">out</span>:airvehicles.dll helicopter.cs</pre>
<p>At this point, your directory should contain the primary airvehicles.dll module as well as the
secondary ufo.netmodule binaries.</p>
<h2>Exploring the ufo.netmodule File</h2>
<p>Now, using ildasm.exe, open ufo.netmodule. As you can see, *.netmodules contain a module-level
manifest; however, its sole purpose is to list each external assembly referenced by the code base. Given
that the Ufo class did little more than make a call to Console.WriteLine(), you find the following core
information:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.assembly extern mscorlib
{
    .publickeytoken = (B7 7A 5C 56 19 34 E0 89 )
    .ver 4:0:0:0
}
.module ufo.netmodule
</pre>
<h2>Exploring the airvehicles.dll File</h2>
<p>Next, using ildasm.exe, open the primary airvehicles.dll module and investigate the assembly-level
manifest. Notice that the .file token documents the associated modules in the multifile assembly
(ufo.netmodule in this case). The .class extern tokens are used to document the names of the external
types referenced for use from the secondary module (Ufo). Here is the relevant information:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.assembly extern mscorlib
{
    .publickeytoken = (B7 7A 5C 56 19 34 E0 89 )
    .ver 4:0:0:0
}
.assembly airvehicles
{
...
    .hash algorithm 0x00008004
    .ver 0:0:0:0
}
.file ufo.netmodule
...
.class extern public AirVehicles.Ufo
{
    .file ufo.netmodule
    .class 0x02000002
}
.module airvehicles.dll
</pre>
<p>Again, realize that the only entity that links together airvehicles.dll and ufo.netmodule is the
assembly manifest. These two binary files have not been merged into a single, larger *.dll.</p>
<h2>Consuming a Multifile Assembly</h2>
<p>The consumers of a multifile assembly couldn’t care less that the assembly they are referencing is
composed of numerous modules. To keep things simple, let’s create a new C# client application at the
command line. Create a new file named Client.cs with the following module definition. When you are
done, save it in the same location as your multifile assembly.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> AirVehicles;
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Multifile Assembly Client *****"</span>);
        Helicopter h = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Helicopter();
        h.TakeOff();

        <span class="rem">// This will load the *.netmodule on demand.</span>
        Ufo u = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Ufo();
        u.AbductHuman();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>To compile this executable assembly at the command line, use the C# command-line compiler,
csc.exe, with the following command set:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
csc /r:airvehicles.dll Client.cs</pre>
<p>Notice that when you are referencing a multifile assembly, the compiler needs to be supplied only
with the name of the primary module (the *.netmodules are loaded on demand by the CLR when used by
the client’s code base). In and of themselves, *.netmodules do not have an individual version number
and can’t be directly loaded by the CLR. Individual *.netmodules can be loaded only by the primary
module (e.g., the file that contains the assembly manifest).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Visual Studio 2010 also allows you to reference a multifile assembly. Simply use the Add References
dialog box and select the primary module. Any related *.netmodules are copied during the process.</p>
<p>At this point, you should feel comfortable with the process of building both single-file and multifile
assemblies. To be completely honest, chances are very good that all of your assemblies will be single-file
entities. Nevertheless, multifile assemblies can prove helpful when you wish to break a large physical
binary into modular units (which are quite useful for remote download scenarios). Next up, let’s
formalize the concept of a private assembly.</p>
