<h1>Building a Flowchart Workflow</h1>
<p>In the first example, I had you drag a WriteLine activity directly on the workflow designer. While it is true
that any activity seen in the Visual Studio 2010 Toolbox can be the first item placed on the designer, only
a few of them are able to contain sub-activities (which is obviously very important!). When you are
building a new workflow, the chances are very good that the first item you will place on your designer
will be a Flowchart or Sequence activity.</p>
<p>Both of these built in activities have the ability to contain any number of internal child activities
(including additional Flowchart or Sequence activities) to represent the entirety of your business process.
To begin, let’s create a brand new Workflow Console Application named EnumerateMachineDataWF.
Once you have done so, rename your initial *.xaml file to MachineInfoWF.xaml.</p>
<p>Now, under the Flowchart section of your Toolbox, drag a Flowchart activity onto the designer.
Next, using the Properties window, change the DisplayName property to something a tad more catchy,
such as Show Machine Data Flowchart (as I am sure you can guess, the DisplayName property controls
how the item is named on the designer). At this point, your workflow designer should look something
like Figure 26-7.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_07.png" alt="Figure 26-7" />
<p><b>Figure 26-7</b> The initial Flowchart activity</p>
<p>Be aware that there is a grab-handle on the lower right of the Flowchart activity, which can be used
to increase or decrease the size of the flowchart designer space. You’ll need to increase the size as you
add more and more activities.</p>
<h2>Connecting Activities in a Flowchart</h2>
<p>The large Start icon represents the entry point to the Flowchart activity, which in this example is the first
activity in our entire workflow and will be triggered when you execute the workflow using the
WorkflowInvoker or WorkflowApplication classes. This icon can be positioned anywhere on your
designer, and I’d suggest you move it to the upper left, just to make some more space.</p>
<p>Your goal is to assembly your flowchart by connecting any number of additional activities together,
typically making use of the FlowDecision activity during the process. To start, drag a WriteLine activity
on the designer, changing the DisplayName to Greet User. Now, if you hover your mouse over the Start
icon, you will see one docking tab on each side. Click and hold the docking tab closest to the WriteLine
activity, and drag it to the docking tab of the WriteLine activity. Once you have done so, you should see a
connection between these first two items, signifying that the first activity which will be executed in your
workflow will be Greet User.</p>
<p>Now, similar to the first example, add a workflow argument (via the Arguments button) named
UserName of type string with no default value. This will be passed in dynamically via the custom
Dictionary&lt;&gt; object in just a bit. Finally, set the Text property of the WriteLine activity to the following
code statement:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="str">"Hello"</span> &amp; UserName</pre>
<p>Now, does anything strike you as odd here? If you were authoring C# code, you would encounter an
error beacuse the string concatenation symbol is +, not &amp;! However (and this is the weird part), whenever
you are entering a code condition in a workflow, you must use the syntax of Visual Basic! This is because
the WF 4.0 API is making use of a helper assembly which has been coded to process VB statements rather
than C# statements (strange but true).</p>
<p>Add a second WriteLine activity to your designer, which is connected to the previous. This time,
define a hard coded string value of "Do you want me to list all machine drives?" for the Text
property, and change the DisplayName property to Ask User. Figure 26-8 shows the connections between
current workflow activities.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_08.png" alt="Figure 26-8" />
<p><b>Figure 26-8</b> Flowchart workflows connect activities together</p>
<h2>Working with the InvokeMethod Activity</h2>
<p>Because the majority of a workflow is defined in a declarative manner using XAML, you are sure to make
good use of the InvokeMethod activity, which allows you to invoke methods of real objects at various
points in your workflow. Drag one of these items to your designer, change the DisplayName property to
Get Y or N, and make a connection between it and the Ask User WriteLine activity.</p>
<p>The first property to configure for an InvokeMethod activity is the TargetType property, which
represents the name of the class that defines a static member you wish to invoke. Using the dropdown
list box for the TargetType of the InvokeMethod activity, pick the Browse for Types... option (Figure 26-9).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_09.png" alt="Figure 26-9" />
<p><b>Figure 26-9</b> Specifying a target for InvokeMethod</p>
<p>From the resulting dialog box, pick the System.Console class of mscorlib.dll (if you enter the name
of the type within the Type Name edit area, the dialog will automatically find the type). Once you have
found the System.Console class, click the OK button.</p>
<p>Now, using the InvokeMethod activity on the designer, enter ReadLine as the value for the MethodName
property. This will configure your InvokeMethod activity to invoke the Console.ReadLine() method when
this step of the workflow is reached.</p>
<p>As you know, Console.ReadLine() will return a string value that contains the keystrokes entered on
the keyboard before the Enter key is pressed; however, you need to have a way to capture the return
value! You will do this next.</p>
<h2>Defining Workflow Wide Variables</h2>
<p>Defining a workflow variable in XAML is almost identical to defining an argument, in that you can do so
directly on the designer (this time with the Variables button). The difference is that arguments are used
to capture data passed in by the host, whereas variables are simply points of data in the workflow which
will be used to influence its runtime behavior.</p>
<p>Using the Variables aspect of the designer, add a new string variable named YesOrNo. Notice that if
you have multiple parent containers in your workflow (for example, a Flowchart containing another
Sequence), you can pick the scope of the variable. Here, your only choice is the root Flowchart. Next,
select the InvokeMethod activity on the designer, and using the Properties window of Visual Studio 2010,
set the Result property to your new variable (Figure 26-10).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_10.png" alt="Figure 26-10" />
<p><b>Figure 26-10</b> The fully configured InvokeMethod</p>
<p>Now that you can grab a piece of data from an external method call, you can use it to make a
runtime decision in your flow chart using the FlowDecision activity.</p>
<h2>Working with the FlowDecision Activity</h2>
<p>A FlowDecision activity is used to take two possible courses of action, based on the truth or falsity of a
Boolean variable, or a statement which resolves to a Boolean value. Drag one of these activities onto
your designer, and connect it to the InvokeMethod activity (Figure 26-11).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_11.png" alt="Figure 26-11" />
<p><b>Figure 26-11</b> A FlowDecision can branch two directions</p>
<p><b>Note</b>If you need to respond to multiple branching conditions within a flowchart, make use of the
FlowSwitch&lt;T&gt; activity. This allows you to define any number of paths, which will be entered based on the value
of a defined workflow variable.</p>
<p>Set the Condition property (using the Properties window) of your FlowDecision activity to the
following code statement, which you can type directly into the editor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
YesOrNo.ToUpper() = <span class="str">"Y"</span></pre>
<p>Here you are testing an upper case version of your YesOrNo variable against the value “Y”.
Remember, you are entering VB code here, so you don’t want to use the C# equality operator (==), but
the VB equality operator (=).</p>
<h2>Working with the TerminateWorkflow Activity</h2>
<p>You now need to build the activities which will occur on each side of the FlowDecision activity. On the
“false” side, connect a final WriteLine activity which prints out a hard coded message of your choosing,
followed by a TerminateWorkflow activity (Figure 26-12).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_12.png" alt="Figure 26-12" />
<p><b>Figure 26-12</b> The "false" branch</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you don’t need to use the TerminateWorkflow activity, as this workflow would
simply end once you reach the end of the false branch. However, by using this activity type, you can
throw back an exception to the workflow host, informing them exactly why you are stopping. This
exception can be configured in the Properties window.</p>
<p>Assuming you have selected the TerminateWorkflow activity on the designer, use the Properties
window, and click on the ellipse button for the Exception property. This will open up an editor which
allows you to throw back an exception, just like if you were doing so in code (VB code that is; see
Figure 26-13).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_13.png" alt="Figure 26-13" />
<p><b>Figure 26-13</b> Configuring an exception to throw when the TerminateWorkflow activity is encountered</p>
<p>Complete the configuration of this activity by setting the Reason property to “YesOrNo was false”.</p>
<h2>Building the “True” Condition</h2>
<p>To begin building the “true” condition of the FlowDecision, connect a WriteLine activity, which simply
displays a hard coded string confirming the user has agreed to proceed. From here, connect to a new
InvokeMethod activity, which will call the GetLogicalDrives() method of the System.Environment class.
To do so, set the TargetType property to System.Environment and the MethodName property to
GetLogicalDrives.</p>
<p>Next, add a new workflow level variable (using the Variables button of the workflow designer)
named DriveNames of type string[]. To specify you want an array of strings, pick Array of [T] from the
Variable Type drop down list, and pick string from the resulting dialog box. Figure 26-14 shows the first
part of the “true” condition.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_14.png" alt="Figure 26-14" />
<p><b>Figure 26-14</b> Configuring an exception to throw when the TerminateWorkflow activity is encountered</p>
<p>Now, set the Result property of this new InvokeMethod activity to your DriveNames variable.</p>
<h2>Working with the ForEach&lt;T&gt; Activity</h2>
<p>The next part of your workflow will be to print out the names of each drive to the console window, which
is to say you need to loop over the data exposed by the DriveNames variable, which has been configured
as an array of string objects. The ForEach&lt;T&gt; activity is the WF XAML equivalent of the C# foreach
keyword, and it is configured in a very similar manner (at least conceptually).</p>
<p>Drag one of these activities on your designer and connect it to the previous InvokeMethod activity.
You will configure the ForEach&lt;T&gt; activity in just a minute, but to complete the true condition branch,
place one final WriteLine activity on your designer to close things off. Here is the final top-level look at
your workflow (Figure 26-15).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_15.png" alt="Figure 26-15" />
<p><b>Figure 26-15</b> The completed top-level workflow</p>
<p>To get rid of the current designer error, you need to finish the configuration of the ForEach&lt;T&gt;
activity. First, use the Properties window to specify the type parameter to the generic, which in this
example will be a string type. The Values property is where the data is coming from, which will be your
DriveNames variable (Figure 26-16).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_16.png" alt="Figure 26-16" />
<p><b>Figure 26-16</b> Setting the type of for-each enumeration</p>
<p>This particular activity needs to be further edited by double clicking on the designer in order to
open a brand new mini designer just for this activity. Not all WF 4.0 activities can be double clicked on to
yield a new designer, but you can easily tell if this is an option on the activity itself (it will literally say
“Double-click to view”). Double click on your ForEach&lt;T&gt; activity, and add a single WriteLine activity,
which will print out each string value (Figure 26-17).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure26_17.png" alt="Figure 26-17" />
<p><b>Figure 26-17</b> The final configuration step of the ForEach&lt;T&gt; activity</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You can add as many activities to the ForEach&lt;T&gt; mini designer as you require. The collective whole of
these activities will execute with each iteration of the loop.</p>
<p>Once you have done so, use the links at the upper left of the designer to return to the top level
workflow (you’ll use these bread crumbs quite a bit when drilling into a set of activities).</p>
<h2>Completing the Application</H2>
<p>You are just about done with this example! All you need to do is update the Main() method of the Program
class to catch the exception that will be raised if the user says “NO” and thereby triggers the Exception
object. Update your code as so (and ensure the System.Collections.Generic namespace is imported in
your code file):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        Dictionary&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">object</span>&gt; wfArgs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Dictionary&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">object</span>&gt;();
        wfArgs.Add(<span class="str">"UserName"</span>, <span class="str">"Andrew"</span>);
        WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Workflow1(), wfArgs);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Data[<span class="str">"Reason"</span>]);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the “Reason” for the exception can be obtained using the Data property of
System.Exception. So, if you run the program and enter “Y” when asked to enumerate your drives, you’ll
see the following type of output:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
Hello Andrew
Do you want me to list all machine drives?
y
Wonderful!
C:\
D:\
E:\
F:\
G:\
H:\
I:\
Thanks for using this workflow</pre>
<p>However, if you enter “N” (or any other value other than “Y” or “y”), you will see the following:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
Hello Andrew
Do you want me to list all machine drives?
n
K, bye...
YesOrNo was false</pre>
<h2>Reflecting on What We Have Done</h2>
<p>Now, if you are new to working with a workflow environment, you might be wondering what you have
gained by authoring this very simple business process using WF XAML rather than good-old C# code.
After all, you could have avoided Windows Workflow Foundation all together and simply built the
following C# class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">try</span>
        {
            ExecuteBusinessProcess();
        }
        <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            Console.WriteLine(ex.Data[<span class="str">"Reason"</span>]);
        }
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExecuteBusinessProcess()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> UserName = <span class="str">"Andrew"</span>;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello {0}"</span>, UserName);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Do you want me to list all machine drives?"</span>);

        <span class="kwrd">string</span> YesOrNo = Console.ReadLine();
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (YesOrNo.ToUpper() == <span class="str">"Y"</span>)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Wonderful!"</span>);
            <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] DriveNames = Environment.GetLogicalDrives();
            <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> DriveNames)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Thanks for using this workflow"</span>);
        }
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"K, Bye..."</span>);
            Exception ex = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Exception(<span class="str">"User Said No!"</span>);
            ex.Data[<span class="str">"Reason"</span>] = <span class="str">"YesOrNo was false"</span>;
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>The output of the program would be absolutely identical to the previous XAML based workflow. So,
why bother tinkering with all these activities in the first place? First of all, remember that not everyone is
comfortable reading C# code. Be honest: If you had to explain this business process to a room full of
sales people and non-technical managers, would you rather try to explain this C# code or show them the
flowchart? I know my answer...</p>
<p>More importantly, remember that the WF API has a whole slew of additional runtime services,
including persistence of long running workflows to a database, automatic tracking of workflow events,
and so on (alas, I don’t have time to cover them here). When you think of the amount of work you would
need to do in order to replicate this functionality in a new project, the utility of WF is even clearer.</p>
<p>Finally, by allowing us a declarative way to generate workflows using designers and XAML, we can
offload the construction of a workflow to higher level subject matter experts and managers, while we
incorporate the XAML into our C# projects.</p>
<p>All of this being said, the WF API is not necessarily the correct tool of choice for all .NET programs.
However, for most traditional business applications, the ability to define, host, execute and monitor
workflows in this manner is a very good thing indeed. Like any new technology, you will need to
determine if this is useful for your current project. Let’s see another example of working with the WF API,
this time by packaging up a workflow in a dedicated *.dll.</p>
