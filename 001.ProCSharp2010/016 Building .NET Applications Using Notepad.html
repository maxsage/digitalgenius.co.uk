    <h1>Building .NET Applications Using Notepad++</h1>
    <p>Another text editor I'd like to quickly point out is the open source (and freely downloadable) Notepad++
    application. This tool can be obtained from http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net. Unlike the simple
    Windows Notepad application, Notepad++ allows you to author code in a variety of languages and
    supports various plug-in utilities. In addition, Notepad++ provides a few other niceties, including the
    following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Out-of-the-box support for C# keywords (including keyword color coding)</li>
        <li>Support for syntax folding, which allows you to collapse and expand groups of
        code statements within the editor (similar to Visual Studio 2010/C# 2010 Express)</li>
        <li>The ability to zoom in/zoom out text via Ctrl-mouse wheel</li>
        <li>Configurable autocompletion for a variety of C# keywords and .NET namespaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regarding this last point, the Ctrl+space keyboard combination will activate C# autocompletion
    support (see Figure 2-4).</p>

    <p><b>Figure 2-4.</b> Autocompletion using Notepad++</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> The options displayed by the autocomplete window can be modified and extended. Simply open up the
    C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins\APIs\cs.xml file for editing and add any additional entries.</p>
    <p>I won't go into too many details of Notepad++ beyond what we have examined here. If you require
    more assistance, select the ? ? Help content menu option.</p>
