    <h1>Understanding Automatic Properties</h1>
    <p>When .NET 3.5 was released, the C# language offered yet another way to define simple
        encapsulation services with minimal code, using automatic property syntax. To illustrate,
        create a new C# Console Application project named AutoProps. Now, insert a new C#
        class file (Car.cs) that defines the following class, which encapsulates a single
        point of data using classic property syntax.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A Car type using standard property</span>
<span class="rem">// syntax.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> carName = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Empty;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> carName; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { carName = value; }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>While it is very true that most C# properties contain business rules within their
        set scope, it is not too uncommon that some properties literally have nothing more
        to do than simply assign and return the value straightaway as you see here. In these
        cases, it can become rather verbose to define private backing fields and simple
        property definitions multiple times. By way of an example, if you are modeling a
        class that requires 15 private points of field data, you end up authoring 15 related
        properties that are little more than thin wrappers for encapsulation services.</p>
    <p>To streamline the process of providing simple encapsulation of field data, you may
        use automatic property syntax. As the name implies, this feature will offload the
        work of defining a private backing field and the related C# property member to the
        compiler using a new bit of syntax. Consider the reworking of the Car class, which
        uses this syntax to quickly create three properties:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">//class Car</span>
{
    <span class="rem">// Automatic properties!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Speed { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Color { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
    <p>When defining automatic properties, you simply specify the access modifier, underlying
        data type, property name, and empty get/set scopes. At compile time, your type will
        be provided with an autogenerated private backing field and a fitting implementation
        of the get/set logic.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> The name of the autogenerated private backing field is not visible within 
    your C# code base. The only way to see it is to make use of a tool such as ildasm.exe.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional C# properties, however, it is not possible to build read-only
        or write-only automatic properties. While you might think you can just omit the
        get; or set; within your property declaration as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Read-only property? Error!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> MyReadOnlyProp { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }

<span class="rem">// Write only property? Error!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> MyWriteOnlyProp { <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }</pre>
    <p>this will result in a compiler error. When you are defining an automatic property,
        it must support both read and write functionality. However, it is possible to implement
        an automatic property which defines a more restrictive get or set:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Public get, protected set!</span>
<span class="rem">// You could also set a get / set to private.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> SomeOtherProperty { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }</pre>
    <h2>Interacting with Automatic Properties</h2>
    <p>Because the compiler will define the private backing field at compile time, the class defining automatic
        properties will always need to use property syntax to get and set the underlying value. This is important
        to note because many programmers make direct use of the private fields within a class definition, which
        is not possible in this case. For example, if the Car class were to provide a DisplayStats() method, it
        would need to implement this method using the property name:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="rem">// Automatic properties!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Speed { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Color { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayStats()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Car Name: {0}"</span>, PetName);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Speed: {0}"</span>, Speed);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Color: {0}"</span>, Color);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>When you are using an object defined with automatic properties, you will be able to assign and
    obtain the values using the expected property syntax:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Automatic Properties *****\n"</span>);

    Car c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    c.PetName = <span class="str">"Frank"</span>;
    c.Speed = 55;
    c.Color = <span class="str">"Red"</span>;

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Your car is named {0}? That's odd..."</span>,
        c.PetName);
    c.DisplayStats();

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <h2>Regarding Automatic Properties and Default Values</h2>
    <p>When you use automatic properties to encapsulate numerical or Boolean data, you are
        able to use the autogenerated type properties straightaway within your code base,
        as the hidden backing fields will be assigned a safe default value that can be used
        directly. However, be very aware that if you use automatic property syntax to wrap
        another class variable, the hidden private reference type will also be set to a
        default value of null.</p>
    <p>Consider the following new class named Garage, which makes use of two automatic properties:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Garage
{
    <span class="rem">// The hidden int backing field is set to zero!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> NumberOfCars { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="rem">// The hidden Car backing field is set to null!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car MyAuto { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
    <p>Given C#'s default values for field data, you would be able to print out the value
        of NumberOfCars as is (as it is automatically assigned the value of zero), but if
        you directly invoke MyAuto, you will receive a "null reference exception" at runtime,
        as the Car member variable used in the background has not been assigned to a new
        object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    ...
    Garage g = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Garage();

    <span class="rem">// OK, prints default value of zero.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Number of Cars: {0}"</span>, g.NumberOfCars);

    <span class="rem">// Runtime error! Backing field is currently null!</span>
    Console.WriteLine(g.MyAuto.PetName);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Given that the private backing fields are created at compile time, you will be unable
        to make use of C# field initialization syntax to allocate the reference type directly
        with the new keyword. Therefore, this work will need to be done with class constructors
        to ensure the object comes to life in a safe manner. For example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Garage
{
    <span class="rem">// The hidden backing field is set to zero!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> NumberOfCars { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="rem">// The hidden backing field is set to null!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car MyAuto { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="rem">// Must use constructors to override default</span>
    <span class="rem">// values assigned to hidden backing fields.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Garage()
    {
        MyAuto = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
        NumberOfCars = 1;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Garage(Car car, <span class="kwrd">int</span> number)
    {
        MyAuto = car;
        NumberOfCars = number;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>With this update, you could now place a Car object into the Garage object as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Automatic Properties *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make a car.</span>
    Car c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    c.PetName = <span class="str">"Frank"</span>;
    c.Speed = 55;
    c.Color = <span class="str">"Red"</span>;
    c.DisplayStats();

    <span class="rem">// Put car in the garage.</span>
    Garage g = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Garage();
    g.MyAuto = c;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Number of Cars in garage: {0}"</span>, g.NumberOfCars);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Your car is named: {0}"</span>, g.MyAuto.PetName);

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>As you most likely agree, this is a very nice feature of the C# programming language,
        as you can define a number of properties for a class using a streamlined syntax.
        Be aware of course that if you are building a property that requires additional
        code beyond getting and setting the underlying private field (such as data validation
        logic, writing to an event log, communicating with a database, etc.), you will be
        required to define a "normal" .NET property type by hand. C# automatic properties
        never do more than provide simple encapsulation for an underlying piece of (compiler
        generated) private data.</p>
