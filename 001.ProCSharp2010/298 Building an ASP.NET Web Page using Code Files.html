<h1>Building an ASP.NET Web Page using Code Files</h1>
    <p>While the single file code model can be helpful at times, the default approach taken by Visual Studio
2010 (when creating a new web project) is to make use of a technique known as code-behind, which
allows you to separate your programming code from your HTML presentation logic using two distinct
files. This model works quite well when your pages contain a significant amount of code or when
multiple developers are working on the same website. The code-behind model offers other benefits as
well:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Because code-behind pages offer a clean separation of HTML markup and code, it
is possible to have designers working on the markup while programmers author
the C# code.</li>
 <li>Code is not exposed to page designers or others who are working only with the
page markup (as you might guess, HTML folks are not always interested in viewing
reams of C# code).</li>
 <li>Code files can be used across multiple *.aspx files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which approach you take, there is no difference in terms of performance. In fact, many
ASP.NET web applications will benefit from building sites that make use of both approaches.</p>
<p>To illustrate the code-behind page model, let’s recreate the previous example using a blank Visual
Studio 2010 Web Site template (note that Visual Studio 2010 is not required to build pages using codebehind).
Activate the File &gt; New &gt; Web Site menu option and select the Empty Web Site template, as
shown in Figure 32-16.</p>

<p><b>Figure 32-16</b> The Empty Web Site template</p>
<p>Notice in Figure 32-16 that you are able to select the location of your new site. If you select
File System, your content files will be placed within a local directory and pages will be served via the
ASP.NET development web server. If you select FTP or HTTP, your site will be hosted within a new
virtual directory maintained by IIS. For this example, it makes no difference which option you select, but
for simplicity I suggest selecting the File System option and specifying a new folder named
C:\CodeBehindPageModel.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The Empty Web Site project template will automatically include a web.config file, which is similar to an
App.config file for a desktop executable. You’ll learn about the format of this file later in the chapter.</p>
<p>Now, using Website &gt; Add New Item... menu option, insert a new Web Form item named
Default.aspx. You’ll notice that, by default, the Place code in separate file checkbox is checked
automatically, which is exactly what you want (Figure 32-17).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure32_17.png" alt="Figure 32-17" />
<p><b>Figure 32-17</b> Inserting a new Web Form with code separation</p>
<p>Once again, make use of the designer to build a UI consisting of a Label, Button, and GridView, and
make use of the Properties window to build a UI of your liking.</p>
<p>Note that the &lt;%@Page%&gt; directive has been updated with a few new attributes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="asp">&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true"
    CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="_Default" %&gt;</span></pre>
 <p>The CodeFile attribute is used to specify the related external file that contains this page’s coding
logic. By default, these code-behind files are named by adding the suffix .cs to the name of the *.aspx
file (Default.aspx.cs in this example). If you examine Solution Explorer, you will see this code-behind
file is visible via a subnode on the Web Form icon (see Figure 32-18).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure32_18.png" alt="Figure 32-18" />
    <p><b>Figure 32-18</b> The associated code-behind file for a given *.aspx file</p>
<p>If you were to open your code-behind file, you would find a partial class deriving from
System.Web.UI.Page with support for handling the Load event. Notice that the name of this class
(_Default) is identical to the Inherits attribute within the &lt;%@Page%&gt; directive:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Referencing the AutoLotDAL.dll Assembly</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, when creating web application projects using Visual Studio 2010, you do not
need to manually build a \bin subdirectory and copy private assemblies by hand. For this example,
activate the Add Reference dialog box using the Website menu option and reference AutoLotDAL.dll.
When you do so, you will see the new \bin folder within Solution Explorer, as shown in Figure 32-19.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure32_19.png" alt="Figure 32-19" />
<p><b>Figure 32-19</b> Visual Studio typically maintains special ASP.NET folders</p>
<h2>Updating the Code File</h2>
<p>Handle the Click event for the Button type by double-clicking the Button placed on the designer. As
before, the Button definition has been updated with an OnClick attribute. However, the server-side event
handler is no longer placed within a &lt;script&gt; scope of the *.aspx file but as a method of the _Default
class type.</p>
<p>To complete this example, add a using statement for AutoLotConnectedLayer inside your codebehind
file and implement the handler using the previous logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> AutoLotConnectedLayer;
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }

    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnFillData_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        InventoryDAL dal = <span class="kwrd">new</span> InventoryDAL();
        dal.OpenConnection(<span class="str">@"Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;"</span> +
            <span class="str">"Initial Catalog=AutoLot;Integrated Security=True"</span>);
        carsGridView.DataSource = dal.GetAllInventory();
        carsGridView.DataBind();
        dal.CloseConnection();
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you can run your web site by pressing the Ctrl+F5 key combination. Once again, the
ASP.NET development web server will fire up, serving your page into your hosting browser.</p>
<h2>Compilation Cycle for Multifile Pages</h2>
<p>The compilation process of a page making use of the code-behind model is similar to that of the singlefile
model. However, the type deriving from System.Web.UI.Page is composed of three files rather than
the expected two.</p>
<p>Recall that the Default.aspx file was connected to a partial class named _Default within the codebehind
file. In addition, a third aspect of the partial class generated in memory, which contains inmemory
code that correctly sets properties and events on your web controls.</p>
<p>In any case, once the assembly has been created upon the initial HTTP request, it will be reused for
all subsequent requests, and thus will not have to be recompiled. Understanding this factoid should help
explain why the first request of an *.aspx page takes the longest and subsequent hits to the same page
are extremely efficient.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Under ASP.NET, it is possible to precompile all pages (or a subset of pages) of a website using a
command-line tool named aspnet_compiler.exe. Check out the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for
details.</p>
<h2>Debugging and Tracing ASP.NET Pages</h2>
<p>When you are building ASP.NET web projects, you can use the same debugging techniques as you would
with any other sort of Visual Studio 2010 project type. Thus, you can set breakpoints in your codebehind
file (as well as embedded “script” blocks in an *.aspx file), start a debug session (via the F5 key,
by default), and step through your code.</p>
<p>However, to debug your ASP.NET web applications, your site must contain a properly configured
Web.config file. By default, all Visual Studio 2010 web projects will automatically have a Web.config file.
However, debugging support is initially disabled (as debugging would degrade performance). When you
start a debugging session, the IDE will prompt you whether you would like to modify Web.config to
enable debugging . Once you have opted to do so, the &lt;compilation&gt; element of the Web.config file is
updated like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">compilation</span> <span class="attr">debug</span><span class="kwrd">="true"</span> <span class="attr">targetFramework</span><span class="kwrd">="4.0"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>On a related note, you are also able to enable tracing support for an *.aspx file by setting the Trace
attribute to true within the &lt;%@Page%&gt; directive (it is also possible to enable tracing for your entire site by
modifying the Web.config file):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="asp">&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true"
    CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="_Default" Trace="true" %&gt;</span></pre>
 <p>Once you do, the emitted HTML contains numerous details regarding the previous HTTP
request/response (server variables, session and application variables, request/response, etc.). To insert
your own trace messages into the mix, you can use the Trace property inherited from
System.Web.UI.Page.</p>
<p>Anytime you wish to log a custom message (from a script block or C# source code file), simply call
the static Trace.Write() method. The first argument represents the name of your custom category, the
second argument specifies the trace message. To illustrate, update the Click handler of your Button with
the following code statement:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnFillData_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Trace.Write(<span class="str">"CodeFileTraceInfo!"</span>, <span class="str">"Filling the grid!"</span>);
...
}</pre>
<p>Run your project once again and click the button. You will find your custom category and custom
message are present and accounted for. In Figure 32-20, take note of the highlighted message that
displays the trace information.</p>

<p><b>Figure 32-20</b> Logging custom trace messages</p>
<p>At this point, you have seen how to build a single ASP.NET web page using the single-file and codefile
approach. The remaining topics of this chapter will take a deeper look into the composition of an
ASP.NET web project, as well as ways to interact with the HTTP request/response and the life cycle of a
Page derived class. Before you dive in, I need to clarify the distinction between an ASP.NET Web Site and
an ASP.NET Web Application.</p>
