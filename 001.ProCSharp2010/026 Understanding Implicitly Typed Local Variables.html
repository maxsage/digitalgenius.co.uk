    <h1>Understanding Implicitly Typed Local Variables</h1>
    <p>Up until this point in the chapter, when we have been defining local variables, we've explicitly specified
    the underlying data type of said variable.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DeclareExplicitVars()
{
    <span class="rem">// Explicitly typed local variables</span>
    <span class="rem">// are declared as follows:</span>
    <span class="rem">// dataType variableName = initialValue;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 0;
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> myBool = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> myString = <span class="str">"Time, marches on..."</span>;
}</pre>
    <p>While it is always good practice to explicitly specify the data type of each variable, the C# language
    does provide for implicitly typing of local variables using the var keyword. The var keyword can be used
    in place of specifying a specific data type (such as int, bool, or string). When you do so, the compiler
    will automatically infer the underlying data type based on the initial value used to initialize the local data
    point.</p>
    <p>To illustrate the role of implicit typing, create a new Console Application project named
    ImplicitlyTypedLocalVars. Notice how the local variables within the previous method can now be
    declared as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DeclareImplicitVars()
{
    <span class="rem">// Implicitly typed local variables</span>
    <span class="rem">// are declared as follows:</span>
    <span class="rem">// var variableName = initialValue;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myInt = 0;
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myBool = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myString = <span class="str">"Time, marches on..."</span>;
}
</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> Strictly speaking, var is not a C# keyword. It is permissible to declare variables, parameters, and fields
    named "var" without compile-time errors. However, when the var token is used as a data type, it is contextually
    treated as a keyword by the compiler. For simplicity, I will use the term "var keyword," rather than the more
    cumbersome "contextual var token."</p>
    <p>In this case, the compiler is able to infer, given the initially assigned value, that myInt is, in fact, a
    System.Int32, myBool is a System.Boolean, and myString is indeed of type System.String. You can verify
    this by printing out the type name via reflection. Reflection is the act of determining the composition of a type at runtime. For example, using reflection,
    you can determine the data type of an implicitly typed local variable. Update your method with the
    following code statements:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DeclareImplicitVars()
{
    <span class="rem">// Implicitly typed local variables.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myInt = 0;
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myBool = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myString = <span class="str">"Time, marches on..."</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Print out the underlying type.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myInt is a: {0}"</span>, myInt.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myBool is a: {0}"</span>, myBool.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myString is a: {0}"</span>, myString.GetType().Name);
}</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> Be aware that you can use this implicit typing for any type including arrays, generic types (see Chapter
    10), and your own custom types. You'll see other examples of implicit typing over the course of this book.</p>
    <p>If you were to call the DeclareImplicitVars() method from within Main(), you'd find the output
    shown in Figure 3-17.</p>

    <h2>Restrictions on Implicitly Typed Variables</h2>
    <p>There are, of course, various restrictions regarding the use of the var keyword. First and foremost,
    implicit typing applies only to local variables in a method or property scope. It is illegal to use the var
    keyword to define return values, parameters, or field data of a custom type. For example, the following
    class definition will result in various compile-time errors:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> ThisWillNeverCompile
{
    <span class="rem">// Error! var cannot be used as field data!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">var</span> myInt = 10;

    <span class="rem">// Error! var cannot be used as a return value</span>
    <span class="rem">// or parameter type!</span>
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">var</span> MyMethod(<span class="kwrd">var</span> x, <span class="kwrd">var</span> y){}
}   </pre>
    <p>Also, local variables declared with the var keyword must be assigned an initial value at the exact
    time of declaration and cannot be assigned the initial value of null. This last restriction should make
    sense, given that the compiler cannot infer what sort of type in memory the variable would be pointing
    to based only on null.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! Must assign a value!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> myData;

<span class="rem">// Error! Must assign value at exact time of declaration!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> myInt;
myInt = 0;

<span class="rem">// Error! Can't assign null as initial value!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> myObj = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;</pre>
    <p>It is permissible, however, to assign an inferred local variable to null after its initial assignment
    (provided it is a reference type).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// OK, is SportsCar is a reference type!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar();
myCar = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;</pre>
    <p>Furthermore, it is permissible to assign the value of an implicitly typed local variable to the value of
    other variables, implicitly typed or not.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Also OK!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> myInt = 0;
<span class="kwrd">var</span> anotherInt = myInt;

<span class="kwrd">string</span> myString = <span class="str">"Wake up!"</span>;
<span class="kwrd">var</span> myData = myString;</pre>
    <p>Also, it is permissible to return an implicitly typed local variable to the caller, provided the method
    return type is the same underlying type as the var-defined data point.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetAnInt()
{
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> retVal = 9;
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> retVal;
}</pre>
    <p>Last but not least, be aware that it is illegal to define a nullable implicitly typed local variable using
    the C# ? token (see Chapter 4 for details on nullable data types).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Nope, can't define nullable implicit variables,</span>
<span class="rem">// as implicit variables can never be initially assigned</span>
<span class="rem">// null to begin with!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span>? nope = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar();
<span class="kwrd">var</span>? stillNo = 12;
<span class="kwrd">var</span>? noWay = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;</pre>
    <h2>Implicit Typed Data Is Strongly Typed Data</h2>
    <p>Be very aware that implicit typing of local variables results in strongly typed data. Therefore, use of the
    var keyword is not the same technique used with scripting languages (such as JavaScript or Perl) or the
    COM Variant data type, where a variable can hold values of different types over its lifetime in a program
    (often termed dynamic typing).</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> .NET 4.0 does allow for dynamic typing in C# using a new keyword called�surprise, surprise�dynamic.
    You will learn about this aspect of the language in Chapter 18.</p>
    <p>Rather, type inference keeps the strongly typed aspect of the C# language and affects only the
    declaration of variables at compile time. After that, the data point is treated as if it were declared with
    that type; assigning a value of a different type into that variable will result in a compile-time error.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ImplicitTypingIsStrongTyping()
{
    <span class="rem">// The compiler knows "s" is a System.String.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> s = <span class="str">"This variable can only hold string data!"</span>;
    s = <span class="str">"This is fine..."</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Can invoke any member of the underlying type.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> upper = s.ToUpper();

    <span class="rem">// Error! Can't assign numerical data to a string!</span>
    s = 44;
}</pre>
    <h2>Usefulness of Implicitly Typed Local Variables</h2>
    <p>Now that you have seen the syntax used to declare implicitly typed local variables, I am sure you are
    wondering when to make use of this construct? First and foremost, using var to declare local variables
    simply for the sake of doing so really brings little to the table. Doing so can be confusing to others
    reading your code, as it becomes harder to quickly determine the underlying data type and therefore
    more difficult to understand the overall functionality of the variable. So if you know you need an int,
    declare an int!</p>
    <p>However, as you will see beginning in Chapter 13, the LINQ technology set makes use of query
    expressions that can yield dynamically created result sets based on the format of the query itself. In these
    cases, implicit typing is extremely helpful, as we do not need to explicitly define the type that a query
    may return, which in some cases would be literally impossible to do. Without getting hung up on the
    following LINQ example code, see if you can figure out the underlying data type of subset:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryOverInts()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2, 3, 8 };

    <span class="rem">// LINQ query!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> numbers where i &lt; 10 select i;

    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Values in subset: "</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
    {
        Console.Write(<span class="str">"{0} "</span>, i);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
    
    <span class="rem">// Hmm...what type is subset?</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"subset is a: {0}"</span>, subset.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"subset is defined in: {0}"</span>, subset.GetType().Namespace);
}</pre>
    <p>I'll let the interested reader verify the underlying data type of subset by executing the preceding
    code (and it is not an array of integers!). In any case, it should be clear that implicit typing does have its
    place within the LINQ technology set. In fact, it could be argued that the only time one would make use
    of the var keyword is when defining data returned from a LINQ query. Remember, if you know you need
    an int, just declare an int! Overuse of implicit typing (via the var keyword) is considered bad style in
    production code.</p>
