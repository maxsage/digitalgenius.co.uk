<h1>The Issues with Non-Generic Collections</h1>
<p>When the .NET platform was first released, programmers frequently used the System.Collections
namespace of mscorlib.dll. Here, developers were provided with a set of classes that allowed them to
manage and organize large amounts of data. Table 10-1 documents some of the more commonly used
collection classes, and the core interfaces they implement.</p>

<p>In addition to these core classes (and interfaces), the System.Collections.Specialized namespace
of System.dll added a few (pardon the redundancy) specialized collection types such as BitVector32,
ListDictionary, StringDictionary, and StringCollection. This namespace also contains many
additional interfaces and abstract base classes that you can use as a starting point for creating custom
collection classes.</p>
<p>While it is true that many successful .NET applications have been built over the years using these
"classic" collection classes (and interfaces), history has shown that use of these types can result in a
number of issues.</p>
<p>The first issue is that using the System.Collections and System.Collections.Specialized classes
can result in some poorly performing code, especially when you are manipulating data structures (e.g.,
value types). As you’ll see momentarily, the CLR must perform a number of memory transfer operations
when you store structures in a classic collection class, which can hurt runtime execution speed.</p>
<p>The second issue is that these classic collection classes are not type safe because they were (by-andlarge)
developed to operate on System.Objects, and they could therefore contain anything at all. If a
.NET developer needed to create a highly type safe collection (e.g., a container that can only hold objects
implementing a certain interface), the only real choice was to create a brand new collection class by
hand. Doing so was not too labor intensive, but it was a tad bit on the tedious side.</p>
<p>Given these (and other) issues, .NET 2.0 introduced a brand new set of collection classes, which are
packaged up in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. Any new project created with .NET 2.0 and
higher should ignore the legacy, non-generic classes in favor of the corresponding generic classes.</p>
<p><b>Note </b>This is worth repeating: Any .NET application built with .NET 2.0 or higher should ignore the classes in
System.Collections in favor of the classes in System.Collections.Generic.</p>
<p>Before you look at how to use generics in your programs, you’ll find it helpful to examine the issues
of non-generic collection classes a bit closer; this will help you understand better the problems generics
intend to solve in the first place. If you wish to follow along, create a new Console Application named
IssuesWithNon-genericCollections. Next, import the System.Collections namespace to the top of your
C# code file:</p>

<h2>The Issue of Performance</h2>
<p>As you might recall from Chapter 4, the .NET platform supports two broad categories of data: value types
and reference types. Given that .NET defines two major categories of types, you might occasionally need
to represent a variable of one category as a variable of the other category. To do so, C# provides a simple
mechanism, termed boxing, to store the data in a value type within a reference variable. Assume that you
have created a local variable of type int in a method called SimpleBoxUnboxOperation():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SimpleBoxUnboxOperation()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a ValueType (int) variable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 25;
}</pre>
<p>If, during the course of your application, you were to represent this value type as a reference type,
you would box the value, as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SimpleBoxUnboxOperation()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a ValueType (int) variable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 25;

    <span class="rem">// Box the int into an object reference.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> boxedInt = myInt;
}</pre>
<p>Boxing can be formally defined as the process of explicitly assigning a value type to a System.Object
variable. When you box a value, the CLR allocates a new object on the heap and copies the value type’s
value (25, in this case) into that instance. What is returned to you is a reference to the newly allocated
heap-based object. If you use this technique, you don’t need to use of a set of wrapper classes to treat
stack data temporarily as heap-allocated objects.</p>
<p>The opposite operation is also permitted through unboxing. Unboxing is the process of converting
the value held in the object reference back into a corresponding value type on the stack. Syntactically
speaking, an unboxing operation looks like a normal casting operation. However, the semantics are
quite different. The CLR begins by verifying that the receiving data type is equivalent to the boxed type;
and if so, it copies the value back into a local stack-based variable. For example, the following unboxing
operations work successfully, given that the underlying type of the boxedInt is indeed an int:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SimpleBoxUnboxOperation()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a ValueType (int) variable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 25;

    <span class="rem">// Box the int into an object reference.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> boxedInt = myInt;

    <span class="rem">// Unbox the reference back into a corresponding int.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> unboxedInt = (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)boxedInt;
}</pre>
<p>When the C# compiler encounters boxing/unboxing syntax, it emits CIL code that contains the
box/unbox op codes. If you were to examine your compiled assembly using ildasm.exe, you would find
the following:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void SimpleBoxUnboxOperation() cil managed
{
 // Code size 19 (0x13)
 .maxstack 1
 .locals init ([0] int32 myInt, [1] object boxedInt, [2] int32 unboxedInt)
 IL_0000: nop
 IL_0001: ldc.i4.s 25
 IL_0003: stloc.0
 IL_0004: ldloc.0
 IL_0005: box [mscorlib]System.Int32
 IL_000a: stloc.1
 IL_000b: ldloc.1
 IL_000c: unbox.any [mscorlib]System.Int32
 IL_0011: stloc.2
 IL_0012: ret
} // end of method Program::SimpleBoxUnboxOperation 
</pre>
<p>Remember that unlike when performing a typical cast, you must unbox into an appropriate data
type. If you attempt to unbox a piece of data into the incorrect variable, an InvalidCastException
exception will be thrown. To be perfectly safe, you should wrap each unboxing operation in try/catch
logic; however, this would be quite labor intensive to do for every unboxing operation. Consider the
following code update, which will throw an error because you’re attempting to unbox the boxed int into
a long:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SimpleBoxUnboxOperation()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a ValueType (int) variable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 25;

        <span class="rem">// Box the int into an object reference.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> boxedInt = myInt;

    <span class="rem">// Unbox in the wrong data type to trigger</span>
    <span class="rem">// runtime exception.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="kwrd">long</span> unboxedInt = (<span class="kwrd">long</span>)boxedInt;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (InvalidCastException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>At first glance, boxing/unboxing might seem like a rather uneventful language feature that is more
academic than practical. After all, You will seldom store a local value type in a local object variable, as
seen here. However, it turns out that the boxing/unboxing process is quite helpful because it allows you
to assume everything can be treated as a System.Object, while the CLR takes care of the memory-related
details on your behalf.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a practical use of these techniques. Assume you have created a non-generic
System.Collections.ArrayList to hold onto a batch of numeric (stack-allocated) data. If you were to
examine the members of ArrayList, you would find they are prototyped to operate on System.Object
data. Now consider the Add(), Insert(), Remove() methods, as well as the class indexer:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ArrayList : <span class="kwrd">object</span>,
    IList, ICollection, IEnumerable, ICloneable
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">object</span> value);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Insert(<span class="kwrd">int</span> index, <span class="kwrd">object</span> value);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Remove(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> <span class="kwrd">this</span>[<span class="kwrd">int</span> index] {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>ArrayList has been built to operate on objects, which represent data allocated on the heap, so it
might seem strange that the following code compiles and executes without throwing an error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> WorkWithArrayList()
{
    <span class="rem">// Value types are automatically boxed when</span>
    <span class="rem">// passed to a method requesting an object.</span>
    ArrayList myInts = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArrayList();
    myInts.Add(10);
    myInts.Add(20);
    myInts.Add(35);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Although you pass in numerical data directly into methods requiring an object, the runtime
automatically boxes the stack-based data on your behalf.</p>
<p>Later, if you wish to retrieve an item from the ArrayList using the type indexer, you must unbox the
heap-allocated object into a stack-allocated integer using a casting operation. Remember that the
indexer of the ArrayList is returning System.Objects, not System.Int32s:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> WorkWithArrayList()
{
    <span class="rem">// Value types are automatically boxed when</span>
    <span class="rem">// passed to a member requesting an object.</span>
    ArrayList myInts = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArrayList();
    myInts.Add(10);
    myInts.Add(20);
    myInts.Add(35);

    <span class="rem">// Unboxing occures when a object is converted back to</span>
    <span class="rem">// stack based data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> i = (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)myInts[0];

    <span class="rem">// Now it is reboxed, as WriteLine() requires object types!</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Value of your int: {0}"</span>, i);
    Console.ReadLine();
}
</pre>
<p>Again, note that the stack-allocated System.Int32 is boxed prior to the call to ArrayList.Add() so it
can be passed in the required System.Object. Also note that the System.Object is unboxed back into a
System.Int32 once it is retrieved from the ArrayList using the type indexer, only to be boxed again when
it is passed to the Console.WriteLine() method, as this method is operating on System.Object variables.</p>
<p>Boxing and unboxing are convenient from a programmer’s point of view, but this simplified
approach to stack/heap memory transfer comes with the baggage of performance issues (in both speed
of execution and code size) and a lack of type safety. To understand the performance issues, ponder the
steps that must occur to box and unbox a simple integer:</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  A new object must be allocated on the managed heap.
 </li>
 <li>
  The value of the stack-based data must be transferred into that memory location.
 </li>
 <li>
  When unboxed, the value stored on the heap-based object must be transferred back to the stack.
 </li>
 <li>
  The now unused object on the heap will (eventually) be garbage collected.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>Although this particular WorkWithArrayList() method won’t cause a major bottleneck in terms of
performance, you could certainly feel the impact if an ArrayList contained thousands of integers that
your program manipulates on a somewhat regular basis. In an ideal world, you could manipulate stackbased
data in a container without any performance issues. Ideally, it would be nice if you did not have to
have to bother plucking data from this container using try/catch scopes (this is exactly what generics let
you achieve).</p>
<h2>The Issue of Type Safety</h2>
<p>You touched on the issue of type safety when you looked at unboxing operations. Recall that you must
unbox your data into the same data type it was declared as before boxing. However, there is another
aspect of type safety you must keep in mind in a generic-free world: the fact that a majority of the classes
of System.Collections can typically hold anything whatsoever because their members are prototyped to
operate on System.Objects. For example, this method builds an ArrayList of random bits of unrelated
data:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ArrayListOfRandomObjects()
{
    <span class="rem">// The ArrayList can hold anything at all.</span>
    ArrayList allMyObjects = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArrayList();
    allMyObjects.Add(<span class="kwrd">true</span>);
    allMyObjects.Add(<span class="kwrd">new</span> OperatingSystem(PlatformID.MacOSX, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Version(10, 0)));
    allMyObjects.Add(66);
    allMyObjects.Add(3.14);
}</pre>
<p>In some cases, you will require an extremely flexible container that can hold literally anything (as
seen here). However, most of the time you desire a type-safe container that can only operate on a
particular type of data point. For example, you might need a container that can only hold database
connections, bitmaps, or IPointy-compatible objects.</p>
<p>Prior to generics, the only way you could address this issue of type safety was to create a custom
(strongly typed) collection class manually. Assume you wish to create a custom collection that can only
contain objects of type Person:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Person
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Age {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> FirstName {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> LastName {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person(){}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person(<span class="kwrd">string</span> firstName, <span class="kwrd">string</span> lastName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age)
    {
        Age = age;
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Name: {0} {1}, Age: {2}"</span>,
            FirstName, LastName, Age);
    }
}</pre>
<p>To build a person only collection, you could define a System.Collections.ArrayList member
variable within a class named PersonCollection and configure all members to operate on strongly typed
Person objects, rather than on System.Object types. Here is a simple example (a production-level custom
collection could support many additional members and might extend an abstract base class from the
System.Collections namespace):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> PersonCollection : IEnumerable
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> ArrayList arPeople = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArrayList();

    <span class="rem">// Cast for caller.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person GetPerson(<span class="kwrd">int</span> pos)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (Person)arPeople[pos]; }

    <span class="rem">// Only insert Person objects.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddPerson(Person p)
    { arPeople.Add(p); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ClearPeople()
    { arPeople.Clear(); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Count
    { <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arPeople.Count; } }
    
    <span class="rem">// Foreach enumeration support.</span>
    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arPeople.GetEnumerator(); }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the PersonCollection class implements the IEnumerable interface, which allows a
foreach-like iteration over each contained item. Also notice that your GetPerson() and AddPerson()
methods have been prototyped to operate only on Person objects, not bitmaps, strings, database
connections, or other items. With these types defined, you are now assured of type safety, given that the
C# compiler will be able to determine any attempt to insert an incompatible data type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UsePersonCollection()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Custom Person Collection *****\n"</span>);
    PersonCollection myPeople = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PersonCollection();
    myPeople.AddPerson(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Homer"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 40));
    myPeople.AddPerson(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Marge"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 38));
    myPeople.AddPerson(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Lisa"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 9));
    myPeople.AddPerson(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Bart"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 7));
    myPeople.AddPerson(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Maggie"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 2));
    
    <span class="rem">// This would be a compile-time error!</span>
    <span class="rem">// myPeople.AddPerson(new Car());</span>
    
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Person p <span class="kwrd">in</span> myPeople)
        Console.WriteLine(p);
}</pre>
<p>While custom collections do ensure type safety, this approach leaves you in a position where you
must create an (almost identical) custom collection for each unique data type you wish to contain. Thus,
if you need a custom collection that can operate only on classes deriving from the Car base class, you
need to build a highly similar collection class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarCollection : IEnumerable
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> ArrayList arCars = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArrayList();

    <span class="rem">// Cast for caller.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car GetCar(<span class="kwrd">int</span> pos)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (Car) arCars[pos]; }

    <span class="rem">// Only insert Car objects.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddCar(Car c)
    { arCars.Add(c); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ClearCars()
    { arCars.Clear(); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Count
    { <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arCars.Count; } }

    <span class="rem">// Foreach enumeration support.</span>
    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arCars.GetEnumerator(); }
}</pre>
<p>However, a custom collection class does nothing to solve the issue of boxing/unboxing penalties.
Even if you were to create a custom collection named IntCollection that you designed to operate only
on System.Int32 items, you would have to allocate some type of object to hold the data (e.g.,
System.Array and ArrayList):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> IntCollection : IEnumerable
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> ArrayList arInts = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArrayList();

    <span class="rem">// Unbox for caller.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetInt(<span class="kwrd">int</span> pos)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)arInts[pos]; }

    <span class="rem">// Boxing operation!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddInt(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i)
    { arInts.Add(i); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ClearInts()
    { arInts.Clear(); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Count
    { <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arInts.Count; } }

    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arInts.GetEnumerator(); }
}</pre>
<p>Regardless of which type you might choose to hold the integers, you cannot escape the boxing
dilemma using non-generic containers.</p>
<p>When you use generic collection classes, you rectify all of the previous issues, including
boxing/unboxing penalties and a lack of type safety. Also, the need to build a custom (generic) collection
class manually becomes quite rare. Rather than having to build unique classes that can contain people,
cars, and integers, you can use a generic collection class and specify the type of type. Consider the
following method, which uses a generic List&lt;&gt; class (in the System.Collections.Generic namespace) to
contain various types of data in a strongly typed manner (don’t fret the details of generic syntax at this
time):</p>

    moreInts.Add(2);
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> sum = moreInts[0] + moreInts[1];

}</pre>
<p>The first List&lt;&gt; object can only contain Person objects. Therefore, you do not need to perform a cast
when plucking the items from the container, which makes this approach more type safe. The second
List&lt;&gt; can only contain integers, all of which are allocated on the stack; in other words, there is no
hidden boxing or unboxing as you found with the non-generic ArrayList.</p>
<p>Here is a short list of the benefits generic containers provide over their non-generic counterparts:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Generics provide better performance because they do not result in boxing or
unboxing penalties.
 </li>
 <li>Generics are more type safe because they can only contain the type of type you
specify.
 </li>
 <li>Generics greatly reduce the need to build custom collection types because the
base class library provides several prefabricated containers.
 </li>
</ul>
