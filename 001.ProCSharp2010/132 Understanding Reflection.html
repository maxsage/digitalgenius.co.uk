<h1>Understanding Reflection</h1>
    <p>In the .NET universe, reflection is the process of runtime type discovery. Using reflection services, you
are able to programmatically obtain the same metadata information displayed by ildasm.exe using a
friendly object model. For example, through reflection, you can obtain a list of all types contained within
a given *.dll or *.exe assembly (or even within a *.netmodule file, if you have a multi-file assembly),
including the methods, fields, properties, and events defined by a given type. You can also dynamically
discover the set of interfaces supported by a given type, the parameters of a method, and other related
details (base classes, namespace information, manifest data, and so forth).</p>
<p>Like any namespace, System.Reflection (which is defined in mscorlib.dll) contains a number of
related types. Table 15-1 lists some of the core items you should be familiar with.</p>

<p>To understand how to leverage the System.Reflection namespace to programmatically read .NET
metadata, you need to first come to terms with the System.Type class.</p>
<h2>The System.Type Class</h2>
<p>The System.Type class defines a number of members that can be used to examine a type’s metadata, a
great number of which return types from the System.Reflection namespace. For example,
Type.GetMethods() returns an array of MethodInfo objects, Type.GetFields() returns an array of
FieldInfo objects, and so on. The complete set of members exposed by System.Type is quite expansive;
however, Table 15-2 offers a partial snapshot of the members supported by System.Type (see the .NET
Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details).</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Type

   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>

  <tr>
    <td>
        IsAbstract<br /> 
        IsArray<br />
        IsClass<br />
        IsCOMObject<br />
        IsEnum<br />
        IsGenericTypeDefinition<br />
        IsGenericParameter<br />
        IsInterface<br /> 
        IsPrimitive<br />

        IsNestedPublic<br />
        IsSealed<br />
        IsValueType
   </td>
   <td>
    These properties (among others) allow you to discover a number
of basic traits about the Type you are referring to (e.g., if it is an
abstract entity, an array, a nested class, and so forth).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    GetConstructors()<br />
       GetEvents()<br />
        GetFields()<br />

       GetMembers()<br />
       GetMethods()<br />
       GetNestedTypes()<br />
       GetProperties()  
 </td>
 <td>
  These methods (among others) allow you to obtain an array
representing the items (interface, method, property, etc.) you are
interested in. Each method returns a related array (e.g.,
GetFields() returns a FieldInfo array, GetMethods() returns a
MethodInfo array,etc.). Be aware that each of these methods has
a singular form (e.g.,GetMethod(), GetProperty(), etc.) that
allows you to retrieve a specific item by name, rather than an
array of all related items.

  <tr>
   <td>
    FindMembers()

 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    InvokeMember()  
 </td>
 <td>
  This method allows “late binding” for a given item. You’ll learn
about late binding later in this chapter.

<h2>Obtaining a Type Reference Using System.Object.GetType()</h2>
<p>You can obtain an instance of the Type class in a variety of ways. However, the one thing you cannot do is
directly create a Type object using the new keyword, as Type is an abstract class. Regarding your first
choice, recall that System.Object defines a method named GetType(), which returns an instance of the
Type class that represents the metadata for the current object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Obtain type information using a SportsCar instance.</span>
SportsCar sc = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar();
Type t = sc.GetType();</pre>
<p>Obviously, this approach will only work if you have compile-time knowledge of the type you wish to
reflect over (SportsCar in this case) and currently have an instance of the type in memory. Given this
restriction, it should make sense that tools such as ildasm.exe do not obtain type information by directly
calling System.Object.GetType() for each type, given the ildasm.exe was not compiled against your
custom assemblies!</p>
<h2>Obtaining a Type Reference Using typeof()</h2>
<p>The next way to obtain type information is using the C# typeof operator:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Get the Type using typeof.</span>
Type t = <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(SportsCar);</pre>
<p>Unlike System.Object.GetType(), the typeof operator is helpful in that you do not need to first
create an object instance to extract type information. However, your code base must still have compiletime
knowledge of the type you are interested in examining, as typeof expects the strongly typed name
of the type.</p>
<h2>Obtaining a Type Reference Using System.Type.GetType()</h2>
<p>To obtain type information in a more flexible manner, you may call the static GetType() member of the
System.Type class and specify the fully qualified string name of the type you are interested in examining.
Using this approach, you do not need to have compile-time knowledge of the type you are extracting
metadata from, given that Type.GetType() takes an instance of the omnipresent System.String.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> When I say you do not need compile-time knowledge when calling Type.GetType(), I am referring to
the fact that this method can take any string value whatsoever (rather than a strongly typed variable). Of course,
you would still need to know the name of the type in a “stringified” format!</p>
<p>The Type.GetType() method has been overloaded to allow you to specify two Boolean parameters,
one of which controls whether an exception should be thrown if the type cannot be found, and the other
of which establishes the case sensitivity of the string. To illustrate, ponder the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Obtain type information using the static Type.GetType() method</span>
<span class="rem">// (don't throw an exception if SportsCar cannot be found and ignore case).</span>
Type t = Type.GetType(<span class="str">"CarLibrary.SportsCar"</span>, <span class="kwrd">false</span>, <span class="kwrd">true</span>);</pre>
<p>In the previous example, notice that the string you are passing into GetType() makes no mention of
the assembly containing the type. In this case, the assumption is that the type is defined within the
currently executing assembly. However, when you wish to obtain metadata for a type within an external
private assembly, the string parameter is formatted using the type’s fully qualified name, followed by a
comma, followed by the friendly name of the assembly containing the type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Obtain type information for a type within an external assembly.</span>
Type t = Type.GetType(<span class="str">"CarLibrary.SportsCar, CarLibrary"</span>);</pre>
<p>As well, do know that the string passed into Type.GetType() may specify a plus token (+) to denote a
nested type. Assume you wish to obtain type information for an enumeration (SpyOptions) nested within
a class named JamesBondCar. To do so, you would write the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Obtain type information for a nested enumeration</span>
<span class="rem">// within the current assembly.</span>
Type t = Type.GetType(<span class="str">"CarLibrary.JamesBondCar+SpyOptions"</span>);</pre>
