<h1>Understanding the Format of a .NET Assembly</h1>
    <p>Now that you’ve learned about several benefits provided by the .NET assembly, let’s shift gears and get a
better idea of how an assembly is composed under the hood. Structurally speaking, a .NET assembly
(*.dll or *.exe) consists of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Windows file header</li>
    <li>A CLR file header</li>
    <li>CIL code</li>
    <li>Type metadata</li>
    <li>An assembly manifest</li>
    <li>Optional embedded resources</li>
</ul>
<p>While the first two elements (the Windows and CLR headers) are blocks of data you can typically
always ignore, they do deserve some brief consideration. Here’s an overview of each element.</p>
<h2>The Windows File Header</h2>
<p>The Windows file header establishes the fact that the assembly can be loaded and manipulated by the
Windows family of operating systems. This header data also identifies the kind of application (consolebased,
GUI-based, or *.dll code library) to be hosted by Windows. If you open a .NET assembly using
the dumpbin.exe utility (via a Visual Studio 2010 command prompt) and specify the /headers flag as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
dumpbin /headers CarLibrary.dll</pre>
<p>you can view an assembly’s Windows header information. Here is the (partial) Windows header
information for the CarLibrary.dll assembly you will build a bit later in this chapter (if you would like to
run dumpbin.exe yourself right now, you can specify the name of any *.dll or *.exe you wrote during
this book in place of CarLibrary.dll):</p>

 <p>
 Now, remember that the vast majority of .NET programmers will never need to concern themselves
with the format of the header data embedded in a .NET assembly. Unless you happen to be building a
new .NET language compiler (where you would care about such information), you are free to remain
blissfully unaware of the grimy details of the header data. Do be aware, however, that this information is
used under the covers when Windows loads the binary image into memory.</p>
<h2>The CLR File Header</h2>
<p>The CLR header is a block of data that all .NET assemblies must support (and do support, courtesy of the
C# compiler) in order to be hosted by the CLR. In a nutshell, this header defines numerous flags that
enable the runtime to understand the layout of the managed file. For example, flags exist that identify
the location of the metadata and resources within the file, the version of the runtime the assembly was
built against, the value of the (optional) public key, and so forth. If you supply the /clrheader flag to
dumpbin.exe like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
dumpbin /clrheader CarLibrary.dll</pre>
    <p>you are presented with the internal CLR header information for a given .NET assembly, as shown here:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">

 <p>Again, as a .NET developer you will not need to concern yourself with the gory details of an
assembly’s CLR header information. Just understand that every .NET assembly contains this data, which
is used behind the scenes by the .NET runtime as the image data loads into memory. Now let’s turn our
attention to some information that is much more useful in our day-to-day programming tasks.</p>
<h2>CIL Code, Type Metadata, and the Assembly Manifest</h2>
<p>At its core, an assembly contains CIL code, which, as you recall, is a platform- and CPU-agnostic
intermediate language. At runtime, the internal CIL is compiled on the fly using a just-in-time (JIT)
compiler, according to platform- and CPU-specific instructions. Given this design, .NET assemblies can
indeed execute on a variety of architectures, devices, and operating systems. (Although you can live a
happy and productive life without understanding the details of the CIL programming language, Chapter
17 offers an introduction to the syntax and semantics of CIL.)</p>
<p>An assembly also contains metadata that completely describes the format of the contained types, as
well as the format of external types referenced by this assembly. The .NET runtime uses this metadata to
resolve the location of types (and their members) within the binary, lay out types in memory, and
facilitate remote method invocations. You’ll check out the details of the .NET metadata format in
Chapter 16 during our examination of reflection services.</p>
<p>An assembly must also contain an associated manifest (also referred to as assembly metadata). The
manifest documents each module within the assembly, establishes the version of the assembly, and also
documents any external assemblies referenced by the current assembly (unlike legacy COM type
libraries, which did not provide a way to document external dependencies). As you will see over the
course of this chapter, the CLR makes extensive use of an assembly’s manifest during the process of
locating external assembly references.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> As you will see a bit later in this chapter, a .NET module is a term used to define the parts in a multifile
assembly.</p>
<h2>Optional Assembly Resources</h2>
<p>Finally, a .NET assembly may contain any number of embedded resources, such as application icons,
image files, sound clips, or string tables. In fact, the .NET platform supports satellite assemblies that
contain nothing but localized resources. This can be useful if you wish to partition your resources based
on a specific culture (English, German, etc.) for the purposes of building international software. The
topic of building satellite assemblies is outside the scope of this text; however, you will learn how to
embed application resources into an assembly during our examination of the Windows Presentation
Foundation API in Chapter 30.</p>
<h2>Single-File and Multifile Assemblies</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, an assembly can be composed of multiple modules. A module is really nothing
more than a general term for a valid .NET binary file. In most situations, an assembly is in fact composed
of a single module. In this case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the (logical) assembly
and the underlying (physical) binary (hence the term single-file assembly).</p>
<p>Single-file assemblies contain all of the necessary elements (header information, CIL code, type
metadata, manifest, and required resources) in a single *.exe or *.dll package. Figure 14-2 illustrates
the composition of a single-file assembly.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure14_02.png" alt="Figure 14-2" />
<p><b>Figure 14-2</b> A single-file assembly</p>
<p>A multifile assembly, on the other hand, is a set of .NET modules that are deployed and versioned as
a single logical unit. Formally speaking, one of these modules is termed the primary module and
contains the assembly-level manifest (as well as any necessary CIL code, metadata, header information,
and optional resources). The manifest of the primary module records each of the related module files it
is dependent upon.</p>
<p>As a naming convention, the secondary modules in a multifile assembly take a *.netmodule file
extension; however, this is not a requirement of the CLR. Secondary *.netmodules also contain CIL code
and type metadata, as well as a module-level manifest, which simply records the externally required
assemblies of that specific module.</p>
<p>The major benefit of constructing multifile assemblies is that they provide a very efficient way to
download content. For example, assume you have a machine that is referencing a remote multifile
assembly composed of three modules, where the primary module is installed on the client. If the client
requires a type within a secondary remote *.netmodule, the CLR will download the binary to the local
machine on demand to a specific location termed the download cache. If each *.netmodule is 5MB, I’m
sure you can see the benefit (compared with downloading a single 15MB file).</p>
<p>Another benefit of multifile assemblies is that they enable modules to be authored using multiple
.NET programming languages (which is very helpful in larger corporations, where individual
departments tend to favor a specific .NET language). Once each of the individual modules has been
compiled, the modules can be logically “connected” into a logical assembly using the C# command-line
compiler.</p>
<p>In any case, do understand that the modules that compose a multifile assembly are not literally
linked together into a single (larger) file. Rather, multifile assemblies are only logically related by
information contained in the primary module’s manifest. Figure 14-3 illustrates a multifile assembly
composed of three modules, each authored using a unique .NET programming language.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure14_03.png" alt="Figure 14-3" />
<p><b>Figure 14-3</b> The primary module records secondary modules in the assembly manifest</p>
<p>At this point you should have a better understanding of the internal composition of a .NET binary
file. With that out of the way, we are ready to look at the building and configuring a variety of code
libraries.</p>
