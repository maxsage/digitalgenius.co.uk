<h1>The Directory(Info) and File(Info) Types</h1>
<p>System.IO provides four classes that allow you to manipulate individual files, as well as interact with a
machine’s directory structure. The first two types, Directory and File, expose creation, deletion,
copying, and moving operations using various static members. The closely related FileInfo and
DirectoryInfo types expose similar functionality as instance-level methods (therefore, you must allocate
them with the new keyword). In Figure 20-1, the Directory and File classes directly extend
System.Object, while DirectoryInfo and FileInfo derive from the abstract FileSystemInfo type.</p>

<p><b>Figure 20-1</b> The File- and Directory-centric types</p>
<p>FileInfo and DirectoryInfo typically serve as better choices for obtaining full details of a file or
directory (e.g., time created, and read/write capabilities) because their members tend to return strongly
typed objects. In contrast, the Directory and File class members tend to return simple string values
rather than strongly typed objects.</p>
<h2>The Abstract FileSystemInfo Base Class</h2>
<p>The DirectoryInfo and FileInfo types receive many behaviors from the abstract FileSystemInfo base
class. For the most part, you use the members of the FileSystemInfo class to discover general
characteristics (such as time of creation, various attributes, and so forth) about a given file or directory.
Table 20-2 lists some core properties of interest.</p>

   <td>
    Gets or sets the attributes associated with the current file that are
represented by the FileAttributes enumeration (e.g., is the file or
directory read-only, encrypted, hidden, or compressed?).

<p>FileSystemInfo also defines the Delete() method. This is implemented by derived types to delete a
given file or directory from the hard drive. Also, you can call Refresh() prior to obtaining attribute
information to ensure that the statistics regarding the current file (or directory) are not outdated.</p>
