<h1>Additional ADO.NET Namespaces</h1>
<p>In addition to the .NET namespaces that define the types of a specific data provider, the .NET base class
libraries provide a number of additional ADO.NET-centric namespaces, some of which you can see in
Table 21-3 (again, Chapter 24 will address the assemblies and namespaces specific to Entity
Framework).</p>
<p><b>Table 21-3.</b> Select Additional ADO.NET-Centric Namespaces</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Namespace

   <th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Microsoft.SqlServer.Server
   </td>
   <td>
    This namespace provides types that facilitate CLR and SQL Server 2005 and
later integration services.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.Data
   </td>
   <td>
    This namespace defines the core ADO.NET types used by all data providers,
including common interfaces and numerous types that represent the
disconnected layer (e.g., DataSet and DataTable).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.Data.Common
   </td>
   <td>
    This namespace contains types shared between all ADO.NET data providers,
including the common abstract base classes.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.Data.Sql
   </td>
   <td>
    This namespace contains types that allow you to discover Microsoft SQL
Server instances installed on the current local network.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.Data.SqlTypes
   </td>
   <td>
    This namespace contains native data types used by Microsoft SQL Server. You
can always use the corresponding CLR data types, but the SqlTypes are
optimized to work with SQL Server (e.g., if your SQL Server database contains
an integer value, you can represent it using either int or SqlTypes.SqlInt32).
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Note that this chapter does not examine every type within every ADO.NET namespace (that task
would require a large book all by itself); however, it is quite important that you understand the types
within the System.Data namespace.</p>
