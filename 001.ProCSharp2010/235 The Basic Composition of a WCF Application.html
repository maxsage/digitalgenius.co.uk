<h1>The Basic Composition of a WCF Application</h1>
<p>When you build a WCF distributed system, you will typically do so by creating three interrelated
assemblies:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The WCF Service assembly: This *.dll contains the classes and interfaces that
represent the overall functionality you want to expose to external callers.</li>
 <li>The WCF Service host: This software module is the entity that hosts your WCF
service assembly.</li>
 <li>The WCF client: This is the application that accesses the service’s functionality
through an intervening proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned previously, the WCF service assembly is a .NET class library that contains a number of
WCF contracts and their implementations. The key difference is that the interface contracts are adorned
with various attributes that control data type representation, how the WCF runtime interacts with the
exposed types, and so forth.</p>
<p>The second assembly, the WCF host, can be literally any .NET executable. As you will see later in this
chapter, WCF was set up so that you can exposed services easily from any type of application (e.g.,
Windows Forms, a Windows service, and WPF applications). When you build a custom host, you use the
ServiceHost type and possibly a related *.config file. The latter contains details regarding the serverside
plumbing you wish to use. However, if you use as the host for your WCF service, you don’t need to
build a custom host programmatically because IIS will use the ServiceHost type behind the scenes</p>
<p><b>Note</b> It is also possible to host a WCF service using the Windows Activation Service (WAS); you can consult the
.NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for details.</p>
<p>The final assembly represents the client that makes calls into the WCF service. As you might expect,
this client can be any type of .NET application. Similar to the host, client applications typically use a
client-side *.config file that defines the client-side plumbing. You should also be aware that you can
easily have a client application written in another framework (e.g., Java and) if you build your WCF
service using HTTP-based bindings.</p>
<p>Figure 25-4 illustrates the relationship between these three interrelated WCF assemblies(from a high
level). Behind the scenes, several lower-level details are used to represent the required plumbing (e.g.,
factories, channels, and listeners). These low-level details are usually hidden from view; however, they
can be extended or customized if required. In most cases, the default plumbing fits the bill sufficiently.</p>

<p>It is also worth pointing out that using a server-side or client-side *.config file is technically
optional. If you wish, you can hard-code the host (as well as the client) to specify the necessary
plumbing (e.g., endpoints, binding, and addresses). The obvious problem with this approach is that if
you need to change the plumbing details, you will need to recode, recompile, and redeploy a number of
assemblies. Using a *.config file keeps your code base much more flexible because changing the
plumbing is as simple as updating the file’s content and restarting the application. On the other hand,
programmatic configuration allows an application more dynamic flexibility—it can choose how to
configure the plumbing based on if-tests, for example.</p>
