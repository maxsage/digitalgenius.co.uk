<h1>The System.GC Type</h1>
 <p>The base class libraries provide a class type named System.GC that allows you to programmatically
interact with the garbage collector using a set of static members. Now, do be very aware that you will
seldom (if ever) need to make use of this class directly in your code. Typically, the only time you will use
the members of System.GC is when you are creating classes that make internal use of unmanaged
resources. This could be the case if you are building a class that makes calls into the Windows C-based
API using the .NET platform invocation protocol, or perhaps due to some very low level and complicated
COM interop logic. Table 8-1 provides a rundown of some of the more interesting members (consult the
.NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for complete details).</p>
<p><b>Table 8-1.</b> Select Members of the System.GC Type</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AddMemoryPressure() RemoveMemoryPressure()
   </td>
   <td>
    Allows you to specify a numerical value that represents the
calling object’s “urgency level” regarding the garbage collection
process. Be aware that these methods should alter pressure in
tandem and thus never remove more pressure than the total
amount you have added.
   </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
   <td>
    Collect()
   </td>
   <td>
    Forces the GC to perform a garbage collection. This method has
been overloaded to specify a generation to collect, as well as the
mode of collection (via the GCCollectionMode enumeration).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    CollectionCount()
   </td>
   <td>
    Returns a numerical value representing how many times a given
generation has been swept.

   </td>
   <td>
    Returns the generation to which an object currently belongs.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    GetTotalMemory()
   </td>
   <td>
    Returns the estimated amount of memory (in bytes) currently
allocated on the managed heap. A Boolean parameter specifies
whether the call should wait for garbage collection to occur
before returning.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    MaxGeneration
   </td>
   <td>
    Returns the maximum number of generations supported on the
target system. Under Microsoft’s .NET 4.0, there are three
possible generations: 0, 1, and 2.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    SuppressFinalize()
   </td>
   <td>
    Sets a flag indicating that the specified object should not have
its Finalize() method called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    WaitForPendingFinalizers()
   </td>
   <td>
    Suspends the current thread until all finalizable objects have
been finalized. This method is typically called directly after
invoking GC.Collect().
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><b>Note</b> .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 added the ability to receive notifications when a garbage collection is about to
occur using a handful of new members. While this can be helpful in some limited scenarios, most applications will
not need such functionality, and therefore I have chosen not to cover the details in this edition. If you are
interested, look up “Garbage Collection Notifications” in the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation.</p>
<p>To illustrate how the System.GC type can be used to obtain various garbage collection–centric
details, consider the following Main() method, which makes use of several members of GC:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with System.GC *****"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Print out estimated number of bytes on heap.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Estimated bytes on heap: {0}"</span>,
        GC.GetTotalMemory(<span class="kwrd">false</span>));

    <span class="rem">// MaxGeneration is zero based, so add 1 for display purposes.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"This OS has {0} object generations.\n"</span>,
        (GC.MaxGeneration + 1));

    Car refToMyCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Zippy"</span>, 100);
    Console.WriteLine(refToMyCar.ToString());

    <span class="rem">// Print out generation of refToMyCar object.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Generation of refToMyCar is: {0}"</span>,
        GC.GetGeneration(refToMyCar));

        Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
   <h2>Forcing a Garbage Collection</h2>
   <p>The base class libraries provide a class type named System.GC that allows you to programmatically
interact with the garbage collector using a set of static members. Now, do be very aware that you will
seldom (if ever) need to make use of this class directly in your code. Typically, the only time you will use
the members of System.GC is when you are creating classes that make internal use of unmanaged
resources. This could be the case if you are building a class that makes calls into the Windows C-based
API using the .NET platform invocation protocol, or perhaps due to some very low level and complicated
COM interop logic. Table 8-1 provides a rundown of some of the more interesting members (consult the
.NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for complete details).</p>
<ul>
 <li>Your application is about to enter into a block of code that you don’t want
    interrupted by a possible garbage collection.
  </li>
 <li>
   Your application has just finished allocating an extremely large number of objects
and you wish to remove as much of the acquired memory as soon as possible.
 </li>
</ul>
  <p>If you determine it may be beneficial to have the garbage collector check for unreachable objects,
you could explicitly trigger a garbage collection, as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Force a garbage collection and wait for</span>
    <span class="rem">// each object to be finalized.</span>
    GC.Collect();
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
...
}</pre>
<p>When you manually force a garbage collection, you should always make a call to
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers(). With this approach, you can rest assured that all finalizable objects
(described in the next section) have had a chance to perform any necessary cleanup before your
program continues. Under the hood, GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers() will suspend the calling “thread”
during the collection process. This is a good thing, as it ensures your code does not invoke methods on
an object currently being destroyed!</p>
<p>The GC.Collect() method can also be supplied a numerical value that identifies the oldest
generation on which a garbage collection will be performed. For example, to instruct the CLR to
investigate only generation 0 objects, you would write the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Only investigate generation 0 objects.</span>
    GC.Collect(0);
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
...
}</pre>
    <p>As well, the Collect() method can also be passed in a value of the GCCollectionMode enumeration as
a second parameter, to fine-tune exactly how the runtime should force the garbage collection. This enum
defines the following values:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> GCCollectionMode
{
    <span class="kwrd">Default</span>, // Forced <span class="kwrd">is</span> the current <span class="kwrd">default</span>.
    Forced, // Tells the runtime <span class="kwrd">to</span> collect immediately!
    Optimized // Allows the runtime <span class="kwrd">to</span> determine
    // whether the current time <span class="kwrd">is</span> optimal <span class="kwrd">to</span> reclaim objects.
}</pre>
<p>As with any garbage collection, calling GC.Collect()promotes surviving generations. To illustrate,
assume that our Main() method has been updated as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with System.GC *****"</span>);

    // Print out estimated number of bytes <span class="kwrd">on</span> heap.
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Estimated bytes on heap: {0}"</span>,
        GC.GetTotalMemory(<span class="kwrd">false</span>));

        // MaxGeneration <span class="kwrd">is</span> zero based.
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"This OS has {0} object generations.\n"</span>,
        (GC.MaxGeneration + 1));

    Car refToMyCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Zippy"</span>, 100);
    Console.WriteLine(refToMyCar.ToString());

    // Print out generation of refToMyCar.
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\nGeneration of refToMyCar is: {0}"</span>,
        GC.GetGeneration(refToMyCar));

    // Make a ton of objects <span class="kwrd">for</span> testing purposes.
    <span class="kwrd">object</span>[] tonsOfObjects = <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span>[50000];
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (int i = 0; i &lt; 50000; i++)
        tonsOfObjects[i] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span>();

    // Collect only gen 0 objects.
    GC.Collect(0, GCCollectionMode.Forced);
    GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();

    // Print out generation of refToMyCar.
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Generation of refToMyCar is: {0}"</span>,
        GC.GetGeneration(refToMyCar));

    // See <span class="kwrd">if</span> tonsOfObjects[9000] <span class="kwrd">is</span> still alive.
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (tonsOfObjects[9000] != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Generation of tonsOfObjects[9000] is: {0}"</span>,
            GC.GetGeneration(tonsOfObjects[9000]));
    }
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"tonsOfObjects[9000] is no longer alive."</span>);

    // Print out how many times a generation has been swept.
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\nGen 0 has been swept {0} times"</span>,
        GC.CollectionCount(0));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Gen 1 has been swept {0} times"</span>,
        GC.CollectionCount(1));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Gen 2 has been swept {0} times"</span>,
        GC.CollectionCount(2));
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Here, we have purposely created a very large array of object types (50,000 to be exact) for testing
purposes. As you can see from the output that follows, even though this Main() method only made one
explicit request for a garbage collection (via the GC.Collect() method), the CLR performed a number of
them in the background.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with System.GC *****
Estimated bytes on heap: 70240
This OS has 3 object generations.

Zippy is going 100 MPH

Generation of refToMyCar is: 0
Generation of refToMyCar is: 1
Generation of tonsOfObjects[9000] is: 1

Gen 0 has been swept 1 times
Gen 1 has been swept 0 times
Gen 2 has been swept 0 times
</pre>
<p>At this point, I hope you feel more comfortable regarding the details of object lifetime. In the next
section, we’ll examine the garbage collection process a bit further by addressing how you can build
finalizable objects as well as disposable objects. Be very aware that the following techniques are useful
only if you are building managed classes that maintain internal unmanaged resources.</p>
