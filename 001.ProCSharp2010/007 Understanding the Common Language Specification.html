    <h1>Understanding the Common Language Specification</h1>
     <p>As you are aware, different languages express the same programming constructs in unique, language specific
    terms. For example, in C# you denote string concatenation using the plus operator (+), while in
    VB you typically make use of the ampersand (&amp;). Even when two distinct languages express the same
    programmatic idiom (e.g., a function with no return value), the chances are very good that the syntax
    will appear quite different on the surface.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
    <span class="rem">// C# method returning nothing.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MyMethod()
    {
    <span class="rem">// Some interesting code...</span>
    }</pre>
    <pre>
    ' VB method returning nothing.
    Public Sub MyMethod()
    ' Some interesting code...
    End Sub
    </pre>
    <p>As you have already seen, these minor syntactic variations are inconsequential in the eyes of the
    .NET runtime, given that the respective compilers (csc.exe or vbc.exe, in this case) emit a similar set of
    CIL instructions. However, languages can also differ with regard to their overall level of functionality. For
    example, a .NET language may or may not have a keyword to represent unsigned data, and may or may
    not support pointer types. Given these possible variations, it would be ideal to have a baseline to which
    all .NET-aware languages are expected to conform.</p>
    <p>The CLS is a set of rules that describe in vivid detail the minimal and complete set of features a given
    .NET-aware compiler must support to produce code that can be hosted by the CLR, while at the same
    time be accessed in a uniform manner by all languages that target the .NET platform. In many ways, the
    CLS can be viewed as a subset of the full functionality defined by the CTS.</p>
    <p>The CLS is ultimately a set of rules that compiler builders must conform to if they intend their
    products to function seamlessly within the .NET universe. Each rule is assigned a simple name (e.g., CLS
    Rule 6) and describes how this rule affects those who build the compilers as well as those who (in some
    way) interact with them. The crème de la crème of the CLS is the mighty Rule 1.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><i>Rule 1:</i> CLS rules apply only to those parts of a type that are exposed outside the
            defining assembly.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given this rule, you can (correctly) infer that the remaining rules of the CLS do not apply to the logic
    used to build the inner workings of a .NET type. The only aspects of a type that must conform to the CLS
    are the member definitions themselves (i.e., naming conventions, parameters, and return types). The
    implementation logic for a member may use any number of non-CLS techniques, as the outside world
    won't know the difference.</p>
    <p>To illustrate, the following C# Add() method is not CLS compliant, as the parameters and return
    values make use of unsigned data (which is not a requirement of the CLS):</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Calc
    {
        <span class="rem">// Exposed unsigned data is not CLS compliant!</span>
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">ulong</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">ulong</span> x, <span class="kwrd">ulong</span> y)
        { <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y; }
    }</pre>
    <p>However, if you were to only make use of unsigned data internally in a method as follows,</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Calc
    {
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
        {
            <span class="rem">// As this ulong variable is only used internally,</span>
            <span class="rem">// we are still CLS compliant.</span>
            <span class="kwrd">ulong</span> temp = 0;
            ...
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y;
        }
    }</pre>
    <p>you have still conformed to the rules of the CLS and can rest assured that all .NET languages are able to
    invoke the Add() method.</p>
    <p>Of course, in addition to Rule 1, the CLS defines numerous other rules. For example, the CLS
    describes how a given language must represent text strings, how enumerations should be represented
    internally (the base type used for storage), how to define static members, and so forth. Luckily, you dont
    have to commit these rules to memory to be a proficient .NET developer. Again, by and large, an
    intimate understanding of the CTS and CLS specifications is only of interest to tool/compiler builders.</p>
    <h2>Ensuring CLS Compliance</h2>
    <p>As you will see over the course of this book, C# does define a number of programming constructs that
    are not CLS compliant. The good news, however, is that you can instruct the C# compiler to check your
    code for CLS compliance using a single .NET attribute.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
    <span class="rem">// Tell the C# compiler to check for CLS compliance.</span>
    [assembly: System.CLSCompliant(<span class="kwrd">true</span>)]</pre>
    <p>Chapter 15 dives into the details of attribute-based programming. Until then, simply understand
    that the [CLSCompliant] attribute will instruct the C# compiler to check each and every line of code
    against the rules of the CLS. If any CLS violations are discovered, you receive a compiler error and a
    description of the offending code.</p>
