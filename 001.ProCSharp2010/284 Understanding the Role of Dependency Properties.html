<h1>Understanding the Role of Dependency Properties</h1>
<p>Like any .NET API, WPF makes use of each member of the .NET type system (classes, structures,
interfaces, delegates, enumerations) and each type member (properties, methods, events, constant data,
read-only fields, etc.) within its implementation. However, WPF also supports a unique programming
concept termed a dependency property.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Dependency properties are also part of the Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) API. While a WF
dependency property is constructed in a similar manner as a WPF dependency property, WF uses a different
technology stack to implement them.</p>
<p>Like a “normal” .NET property (often termed a CLR property in the WPF literature), dependency
properties can be set declaratively using XAML or programmatically within a code file. Furthermore,
dependency properties (like CLR properties) ultimately exist to encapsulate data fields of a class and
can be configured as read-only, write-only or read-write.</p>
<p>To make matters more interesting, in almost every case you will be blissfully unaware that you have
actually set (or accessed) a dependency property as opposed to a CLR property! For example, the Height
and Width properties that WPF controls inherit from FrameworkElement, as well as the Content member
inherited from ControlContent, are all, in fact, dependency properties:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Set three dependency properties! --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span> = <span class="kwrd">"btnMyButton"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span> = <span class="kwrd">"50"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span> = <span class="kwrd">"100"</span> <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"OK"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>Given all of these similarities, why does WPF defines a new term for such a familiar concept? The
answer lies in how a dependency property is implemented within the class. You’l see a coding example
in just a little bit; however, from a high level, all dependency properties are created in the following
manner:</p>
<ul>
 <li>First, the class that defined a dependency property must have DependencyObject in
its inheritance chain.</li>
 <li>A single dependency property is represented as a public, static, read-only field in
the class of type DependencyProperty. By convention, this field is named by
suffixing the word Property to the name of the CLR wrapper (see final bullet
point).</li>
 <li>The DependencyProperty variable is registered via a static call to
DependencyProperty.Register(), which typically occurs in a static constructor or
inline when the variable is declared.
 </li>
     <li>Finally, the class will define a XAML-friendly CLR property, which makes calls to
methods provided by DependencyObject to get and set the value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once implemented, dependency properties provide a number of powerful features that are used by
various WPF technologies including data binding, animation services, styles, and so forth. In a nutshell,
the motivation of dependency properties is to provide a way to compute the value of a property based
on the value of other inputs. Here is a list of some of these key benefits, which go well beyond those of
the simple data encapsulation found with a CLR property:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Dependency properties can inherit their values from a parent element’s XAML
definition. For example, if you defined a value for the FontSize attribute in the
opening tag of a &lt;Window&gt;, all controls in that Window would have the same font size
by default.</li>
 <li>Dependency properties support the ability to have values set by elements
contained within their XAML scope, such as a Button setting the Dock property of a
DockPanel parent. (Recall from Chapter 28 that attached properties do this very
thing, as attached properties are a form of dependency properties.)</li>
 <li>Dependency properties allow WPF to compute a value based on multiple external
values, which can be very important for animation and data binding services.</li>
 <li>Dependency properties provide infrastructure support for WPF triggers (also used
quite often when working with animation and data binding).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now remember, in many cases you will interact with an existing dependency property in a manner
identical to a normal CLR property (thanks to the XAML wrapper). However, when I covered data
binding in Chapter 28, you learned that if you need to establish a data binding in code, you must call the
SetBinding() method on the object that is the destination of the operation and specify the dependency
property it will operate on:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetBindings()
{
    Binding b = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Binding();
    b.Converter = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyDoubleConverter();
    b.Source = <span class="kwrd">this</span>.mySB;
    b.Path = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PropertyPath(<span class="str">"Value"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Specify the dependency property!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.labelSBThumb.SetBinding(Label.ContentProperty, b);
}</pre>
<p>You also saw similar code when you examined how to start an animation in code, back in the
previous chapter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Specify the dependency property!</span>
rt.BeginAnimation(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, dblAnim);</pre>
<p>The only time when you would need to build your own custom dependency property is when you
are authoring a custom WPF control. For example, if you are building a  which defines four
custom properties and you want these properties to integrate well within the WPF API, you should
author them using dependency property logic.</p>
<p>Specifically, if your properties need to be the target of a data binding or animation operation, if the
property must broadcast when it has changed, if it must be able to work as a Setter in a WPF style, or if it
must be able to receive their values from a parent element, a normal CLR property will not be enough. If
you were to use a normal CLR property, other programmers may indeed be able to get and set a value;
however, if they attempt to use your properties within the context of a WPF service, things will not work
as expected. Because you can never know how others might want to interact with the properties of your
custom  classes, you should get in the habit of always defining dependency properties when
building custom controls.</p>
<h2>Examining an Existing Dependency Property</h2>
<p>Before you learn how to build a custom dependency property, let’s take a look at how the Height
property of the FrameworkElement class has been implemented internally. The relevant code is shown
here (with my included comments); however, you can view the same code yourself if you make use of
reflector.exe (just use the View | Search option).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// FrameworkElement is-a DependencyObject.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> FrameworkElement : UIElement, IFrameworkInputElement,
    IInputElement, ISupportInitialize, IHaveResources, IQueryAmbient
{
...

            <span class="str">"Height"</span>,
            <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">double</span>),
            <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(FrameworkElement),

                FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.AffectsMeasure,
                <span class="kwrd">new</span> PropertyChangedCallback(FrameworkElement.OnTransformDirty)),
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> ValidateValueCallback(FrameworkElement.IsWidthHeightValid));
    }

    <span class="rem">// The CLR wrapper, which is implemented using</span>
    <span class="rem">// the inherited GetValue()/SetValue() methods.</span>

        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (<span class="kwrd">double</span>) <span class="kwrd">base</span>.GetValue(HeightProperty); }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { <span class="kwrd">base</span>.SetValue(HeightProperty, value); }
    }
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, dependency properties require quite a bit of additional code from a normal
CLR property! And in reality, a dependency can be even more complex than what you see here
(thankfully, many implementations are simpler than Height).</p>
<p>First and foremost, remember that if a class wants to define a dependency property, it must have
DependencyObject in the inheritance chain, as this is the class which defines the GetValue() and
SetValue() methods used in the CLR wrapper. Since FrameworkElement is-a DependencyObject, this
requirement is satisfied.</p>
<p>Next, recall that the entity which will hold the actual value of the property (a double in the case of
Height) is represented as a public, static read-only field of type DependencyProperty. The name of this
field should, by convention, always be named by suffixing the word Property to the name of the related
CLR wrapper, like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> DependencyProperty HeightProperty;</pre>
    <p>Given that dependency properties are declared as static fields, they are typically created (and
registered) within the static constructor of the class. The DependencyProperty object is created via a call
to the static DependencyProperty.Register() method. This method has been overloaded many times;
however, in the case of Height, DependencyProperty.Register() is invoked as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
HeightProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(
    <span class="str">"Height"</span>,
    <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">double</span>),
    <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(FrameworkElement),
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> FrameworkPropertyMetadata((<span class="kwrd">double</span>)0.0,
        FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.AffectsMeasure,
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> PropertyChangedCallback(FrameworkElement.OnTransformDirty)),
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> ValidateValueCallback(FrameworkElement.IsWidthHeightValid));</pre>
 <p>The first argument to DependencyProperty.Register() is the name of the normal CLR property on
the class (Height in this case), while the second argument is the type information of the underlying data
type it is encapsulating (a double). The third argument specifies the type information of the class that
this property belongs to (FrameworkElement in this case). While this might seem redundant (after all, the
HeightProperty field is already defined within the FrameworkElement class), this is a very clever aspect of
WPF in that it allows one class to register properties on another (even if the class definition has been
sealed!).</p>
<p>The fourth argument passed to DependencyProperty.Register() in this example is what really gives
dependency properties their own unique flavor. Here a FrameworkPropertyMetadata object is passed that
describes various details regarding how WPF should handle this property with respect to callback
notifications (if the property needs to notify others when the value changes) and various options
(represented by the FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions enum) that control what is effected by the
property in question (Does it work with data binding?, Can it be inherited?, etc.). In this case, the
constructor arguments of FrameworkPropertyMetadata break down as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">new</span> FrameworkPropertyMetadata(
    <span class="rem">// Default value of property.</span>
    (<span class="kwrd">double</span>)0.0,

    <span class="rem">// Metadata options.</span>
    FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.AffectsMeasure,
    
    <span class="rem">// Delegate pointing to method called when property changes.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> PropertyChangedCallback(FrameworkElement.OnTransformDirty)
)</pre>
<p>Because the final argument to the FrameworkPropertyMetadata constructor is a delegate, note that its
constructor parameter is pointing to a static method on the FrameworkElement class named
OnTransformDirty(). I won’t bother to show the code behind this method, but be aware that any time
you are building a custom dependency property, you can specify a PropertyChangedCallback delegate to
point to a method that will be called when your property value has been changed.</p>
<p>This brings me to the final parameter passed to the DependencyProperty.Register() method, a
second delegate of type ValidateValueCallback, which points to a method on the FrameworkElement class
which is called to ensure the value assigned to the property is valid:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">new</span> ValidateValueCallback(FrameworkElement.IsWidthHeightValid)</pre>
<p>This method contains logic you might normally expect to find in the set block of a property (more
information on this point in the next section):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsWidthHeightValid(<span class="kwrd">object</span> value)
{
    <span class="kwrd">double</span> num = (<span class="kwrd">double</span>) value;
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> ((!DoubleUtil.IsNaN(num) &amp;&amp; (num &gt;= 0.0))
        &amp;&amp; !<span class="kwrd">double</span>.IsPositiveInfinity(num));
}</pre>
    <p>Once the DependencyProperty object has been registered, the final task is to wrap the field within a
normal CLR property (Height in this case). Notice, however, that the get and set scopes do not simply
return or set a class-level double-member variable, but do so indirectly using the GetValue() and
SetValue() methods from the System.Windows.DependencyObject base class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> Height
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> (<span class="kwrd">double</span>) <span class="kwrd">base</span>.GetValue(HeightProperty); }
    <span class="kwrd">set</span> { <span class="kwrd">base</span>.SetValue(HeightProperty, value); }
}</pre>
    <h2>Important Notes Regarding CLR Property Wrappers</h2>
<p>So, just to recap the story thus far, dependency properties look like a normal every day property when
you get or set their values in XAML or code, but behind the scenes they are implemented with much
more elaborate coding techniques. Remember, the whole reason to go through this process is to build a
custom control that has custom properties that need to integrate with WPF services that demand
communication with a dependency property (e.g., animation, data binding, and styles).</p>
<p>Even though part of the implementation of a dependency property includes defining a CLR
wrapper, you should never put validation logic in the set block. For that matter, the CLR wrapper of a
dependency property should never do anything other than call GetValue() or SetValue().</p>
<p>The reason is that the WPF runtime has been constructed in such a way that when you write XAML
that seems to set a property, such as</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="myButton"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="100"</span> ...<span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>the runtime will completely bypass the set block of the Height property and directly call SetValue()!
The reason for this odd behavior has to do with a simple optimization technique. If the WPF runtime
were to directly call the set block of the Height property, it would have to perform runtime reflection to
figure out where the DependencyProperty field (specified by the first argument to SetValue()) is located,
reference it in memory, and so forth. The same story holds true if you were write XAML which retrieves
the value of the Height property; GetValue() is called directly.</p>
<p>Since this is the case, why do you need to build this CLR wrapper at all? Well, WPF XAML does not
allow you to call functions in markup, so the following markup would be an error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Nope! Can't call methods in WPF XAML! --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="myButton"</span> <span class="attr">this</span>.<span class="attr">SetValue</span>(<span class="kwrd">"100"</span>) ...<span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>In effect, when you set or get a value in markup using the CLR wrapper, think of it as a way to tell the
WPF runtime, "Hey! Go call GetValue() / SetValue() for me, since I can’t do it in markup!"</p>
<p>Now, what if you call the CLR wrapper in code like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Button b = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Button();
b.Height = 10;</pre>
<p>In this case, if the set block of the Height property contained code other than a call to SetValue(), it
would execute as the WPF XAML parser optimization is not involved. The short answer is that when
registering a dependency property, use a ValidateValueCallaback delegate to point to a method that
performs the data validation. This ensures that the correct behavior will occur, regardless of whether you
use XAML or code to get/set a dependency property.</p>
