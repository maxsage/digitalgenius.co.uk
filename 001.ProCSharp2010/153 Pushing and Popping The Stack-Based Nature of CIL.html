<h1>Pushing and Popping: The Stack-Based Nature of CIL</h1>
    <p>Higher-level .NET languages (such as C#) attempt to hide low-level CIL grunge from view as much as
possible. One aspect of .NET development that is particularly well hidden is the fact that CIL is a stackbased
programming language. Recall from the examination of the collection namespaces (see Chapter
10) that the Stack&lt;T&gt; class can be used to push a value onto a stack as well as pop the topmost value off
of the stack for use. Of course, CIL developers do not literally use an object of type Stack&lt;T&gt; to load and
unload the values to be evaluated; however, the same pushing and popping mind-set still applies.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, the entity used to hold a set of values to be evaluated is termed the virtual
execution stack. As you will see, CIL provides a number of opcodes that are used to push a value onto the
stack; this process is termed loading. As well, CIL defines a number of additional opcodes that transfer
the topmost value on the stack into memory (such as a local variable) using a process termed storing.</p>
<p>In the world of CIL, it is impossible to access a point of data directly, including locally defined
variables, incoming method arguments, or field data of a type. Rather, you are required to explicitly load
the item onto the stack, only to then pop it off for later use (keep this point in mind, as it will help explain
why a given block of CIL code can look a bit redundant).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Recall that CIL is not directly executed, but compiled on demand. During the compilation of CIL code,
many of these implementation redundancies are optimized away. Furthermore, if you enable the code optimization
option for your current project (using the Build tab of the Visual Studio Project Properties window), the compiler will
also remove various CIL redundancies.</p>
<p>To understand how CIL leverages a stack-based processing model, consider a simple C# method,
PrintMessage(), which takes no arguments and returns void. Within the implementation of this method,
you will simply print out the value of a local string variable to the standard output stream:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintMessage()
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> myMessage = <span class="str">"Hello."</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(myMessage);
}</pre>
<p>If you were to examine how the C# compiler translates this method in terms of CIL, you would first
find that the PrintMessage() method defines a storage slot for a local variable using the .locals
directive. The local string is then loaded and stored in this local variable using the ldstr (load string) and
stloc.0 opcodes (which can be read as “store the current value in a local variable at storage slot zero”).</p>
<p>The value (again, at index 0) is then loaded into memory using the ldloc.0 (“load the local argument
at index 0”) opcode for use by the System.Console.WriteLine() method invocation (specified using the
call opcode). Finally, the function returns via the ret opcode. Here is the (annotated) CIL code for the
PrintMessage() method:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig instance void PrintMessage() cil managed
{
	.maxstack 1
	// Define a local string variable (at index 0).
	.locals init ([0] string myMessage)

	// Load a string on to the stack with the value "Hello."
	ldstr " Hello."

	// Store string value on the stack in the local variable.
	stloc.0

	// Load the value at index 0.
	ldloc.0

	// Call method with current value.
	call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
	ret
}
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> As you can see, CIL supports code comments using the double-slash syntax (as well as the /*...*/ syntax,
for that matter). As in C#, code comments are completely ignored by the CIL compiler.</p>
<p>Now that you have the basics of CIL directives, attributes, and opcodes, let’s see a practical use of
CIL programming, beginning with the topic of round-trip engineering.</p>
