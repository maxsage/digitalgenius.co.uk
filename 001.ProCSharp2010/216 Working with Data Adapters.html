<h1>Working with Data Adapters</h1>
<p>Now that you understand the ins-and-outs of manipulating ADO.NET DataSets manually, it’s time to
turn your attention to the topic of data adapter objects. A data adapter is a class used to fill a DataSet with
DataTable objects; this class can also send modified DataTables back to the database for processing.
Table 22-8 documents the core members of the DbDataAdapter base class, the common parent to every
data adapter object (e.g., SqlDataAdapter and OdbcDataAdapter).</p>
<p><b>Table 22-8.</b> Core Members of the DbDataAdapter Class</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Members
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Fill()
   </td>
   <td>
    Executes a SQL SELECT command (as specified by the SelectCommand
property) to query the database for data and loads the data into a
DataTable.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    SelectCommand InsertCommand UpdateCommand DeleteCommand
   </td>
   <td>
    Establishes the SQL commands that you will issue to the data store when
the Fill() and Update() methods are called.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Update()
   </td>
   <td>
    Executes SQL INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands (as specified by
the InsertCommand, UpdateCommand, and DeleteCommand properties) to
persist DataTable changes to the database.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Notice that a data adapter defines four properties: SelectCommand, InsertCommand, UpdateCommand,
and DeleteCommand. When you create the data adapter object for your particular data provider (e.g.,
SqlDataAdapter), you can pass in a string that represents the command text used by the SelectCommand’s
command object.</p>
<p>Assuming each of the four command objects has been properly configured, you can then call the
Fill() method to obtain a DataSet (or a single DataTable, if you wish). To do so, you have the data
adapter execute the SQL SELECT statement specified by the SelectCommand property.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you wish to persist a modified DataSet (or DataTable) object back to the database, you
can call the Update() method, which will use any of the remaining command objects, based on the state
of each row in the DataTable (you’ll learn more about this in a bit).</p>
<p>One of the strangest aspects of working with a data adapter object is the fact that you are never
required to open or close a connection to the database. Rather, the underlying connection to the
database is managed on your behalf. However, you will still need to supply the data adapter with a valid
connection object or a connection string (which you will use to build a connection object internally) to
inform the data adapter exactly which database you wish to communicate with.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> A data adapter is agnostic by nature. You can plug in different connection objects and command objects
on the fly and fetch data from a diverse variety of databases. For example, a single DataSet could contain table
data obtained from SQL server, Oracle, and MySQL database providers.</p>
<h2>A Simple Data Adapter Example</h2>
<p>The next step is to add new functionality to the data access library assembly (AutoLotDAL.dll) you
created in Chapter 21. Begin by creating a simple example that fills a DataSet with a single table using an
ADO.NET data adapter object.</p>
<p>Create a new Console Application named FillDataSetUsingSqlDataAdapter and import the
System.Data and System.Data.SqlClient namespaces into your initial C# code file. Now update your
Main() method as follows (you might need to change the connection string, based on how you created
the AutoLot database in the previous chapter):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Data Adapters *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Hard-coded connection string.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> cnStr = <span class="str">"Integrated Security = SSPI;Initial Catalog=AutoLot;"</span> +
        <span class="str">@"Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Caller creates the DataSet object.</span>
    DataSet ds = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataSet(<span class="str">"AutoLot"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Inform adapter of the Select command text and connection string.</span>
    SqlDataAdapter dAdapt =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlDataAdapter(<span class="str">"Select * From Inventory"</span>, cnStr);

    <span class="rem">// Fill our DataSet with a new table, named Inventory.</span>
    dAdapt.Fill(ds, <span class="str">"Inventory"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Display contents of DataSet.</span>
    PrintDataSet(ds);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that you construct the data adapter by specifying a string literal that will map to the SQL
Select statement. You will use this value to build a command object internally, which you can obtain
later using the SelectCommand property.</p>
<p>Next, notice that it is the job of the caller to create an instance of the DataSet type, which is passed
into the Fill() method. Optionally, you can pass the Fill() method as a second argument a string
name that you use to set the TableName property of the new DataTable (if you do not specify a table name,
the data adapter will simply name the table, Table). In most cases, the name you assign a DataTable will
be identical to the name of the physical table in the relational database; however, this is not required.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The Fill() method returns an integer that represents the number of rows returned by the SQL query.</p>
<p>Finally, notice that you do not explicitly open or close the connection to the database anywhere in
the Main() method. You preprogram the Fill() method of a given data adapter to open and then close
the underlying connection before returning from the Fill() method. Therefore, when you pass the
DataSet to the PrintDataSet() method (implemented earlier in this chapter), you are operating on a
local copy of disconnected data, incurring no round-trips to fetch the data.</p>
<h2>Mapping Database Names to Friendly Names</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, database administrators tend to create table and column names that are less
than friendly to end users (e.g., au_id, au_fname, and au_lname). The good news is that data adapter
objects maintain an internal strongly typed collection (named DataTableMappingCollection) of
System.Data.Common.DataTableMapping objects. You can access this collection using the TableMappings
property of your data adapter object.</p>
<p>If you so choose, you can manipulate this collection to inform a DataTable which display names it
should use when asked to print its contents. For example, assume that you wish to map the table name
Inventory to Current Inventory for display purposes. For example, assume you wish to display the CarID
column name as Car ID (note the extra space) and the PetName column name as Name of Car. To do so,
add the following code before calling the Fill() method of your data adapter object (be sure to import
the System.Data.Common namespace to gain the definition of the DataTableMapping type):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Now map DB column names to user-friendly names.</span>
    DataTableMapping custMap =
        dAdapt.TableMappings.Add(<span class="str">"Inventory"</span>, <span class="str">"Current Inventory"</span>);
    custMap.ColumnMappings.Add(<span class="str">"CarID"</span>, <span class="str">"Car ID"</span>);
    custMap.ColumnMappings.Add(<span class="str">"PetName"</span>, <span class="str">"Name of Car"</span>);
    dAdapt.Fill(ds, <span class="str">"Inventory"</span>);
...
}</pre>
<p>If you were to run this program again, you would find that the PrintDataSet() method now displays
the friendly names of the DataTable and DataRow objects, rather than the names established by the
database schema:</p>
