<h1>The Issue of State</h1>
    <p>At the beginning of the Chapter 32, I pointed out that HTTP on the Web results in a stateless wire
protocol. This very fact makes web development extremely different from the process of building an
executable assembly. For example, when you are building a Windows Forms application, you can rest
assured that any member variables defined in the Form-derived class will typically exist in memory until
the user explicitly shuts down the executable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainWindow : Form
{
    <span class="rem">// State data!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> userFavoriteCar = <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>;
}</pre>
    <p>In the World Wide Web environment, however, you are not afforded the same luxurious
assumption. To prove the point, create a new Empty Web Site project named SimpleStateExample and
insert a new Web Form. In the code-behind file of your *.aspx file, define a page-level string variable
named userFavoriteCar:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="rem">// State data?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> userFavoriteCar = <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }
}</pre>
<p>Next, construct the web UI as shown in Figure 34-1.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure34_01.png" alt="Figure 34-01" />
<p><b>Figure 34-1</b> The UI for the simple state page</p>
<p>The server-side Click event handler for the Set button (named btnSetCar) allows the user to assign
the string member variable to the value within the TextBox (named txtFavCar):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSetCar_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Store fave car in member variable.</span>
    userFavoriteCar = txtFavCar.Text;
}</pre>
<p>The Click event handler for the Get button (btnGetCar) displays the current value of the member
variable within the page’s Label widget (lblFavCar):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetCar_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Show value of member variable.</span>
    lblFavCar.Text = userFavoriteCar;
}</pre>
<p>Now, if you were building a Windows Forms application, you would be right to assume that once
the user sets the initial value, it would be remembered throughout the life of the desktop application.
Sadly, when you run this web application, you find that each time you post back to the web server (by
clicking either button), the value of the userFavoriteCar string variable is set back to the initial value of
“Yugo”; therefore, the Label’s text is continuously fixed.</p>
<p>Again, given that HTTP has no clue how to automatically remember data once the HTTP response
has been sent, it stands to reason that the Page object is destroyed almost instantly. As a result, when the
client posts back to the *.aspx file, a new Page object is constructed that will reset any page-level
member variables. This is clearly a major issue. Imagine how useless online shopping would be if every
time you posted back to the web server, any and all information you previously entered (such as the
items you wished to purchase) were discarded. When you wish to remember information regarding the
users who are logged on to your site, you need to make use of various state management techniques.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> This issue is in no way limited to ASP.NET. Java web applications, CGI applications, classic ASP
applications, and PHP applications all must contend with the thorny issue of state management.</p>
<p>To remember the value of the userFavoriteCar string type between postbacks, one approach is to
store the value of this string type in a session variable. We will examine the details of session state in the
pages that follow. For the sake of completion, however, here are the necessary updates for the current
page (note that you are no longer using the private string member variable, so feel free to comment out
or remove the definition altogether):</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="rem">// State data?</span>
    <span class="rem">// private string userFavoriteCar = "Yugo";</span>
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }

    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSetCar_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Store value to be remembered in session variable.</span>
        Session[<span class="str">"UserFavCar"</span>] = txtFavCar.Text;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetCar_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get session variable value.</span>
        lblFavCar.Text = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)Session[<span class="str">"UserFavCar"</span>];
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you now run the application, the value of your favorite automobile will be preserved across
postbacks, thanks to the HttpSessionState object manipulated indirectly by the inherited Session
property.</p>
