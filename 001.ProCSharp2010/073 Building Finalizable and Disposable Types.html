<h1>Building Finalizable and Disposable Objects</h1>
   <p>At this point, we have seen two different approaches to constructing a class that cleans up internal
unmanaged resources. On the one hand, you can override System.Object.Finalize(). Using this
technique, you have the peace of mind that comes with knowing the object cleans itself up when
garbage-collected (whenever that may be) without the need for user interaction. On the other hand, you
can implement IDisposable to provide a way for the object user to clean up the object as soon as it is
finished. However, if the caller forgets to call Dispose(), the unmanaged resources may be held in
memory indefinitely.</p>
<p>As you might suspect, it is possible to blend both techniques into a single class definition. By doing
so, you gain the best of both models. If the object user does remember to call Dispose(), you can inform
the garbage collector to bypass the finalization process by calling GC.SuppressFinalize(). If the object
user forgets to call Dispose(), the object will eventually be finalized and have a chance to free up the
internal resources. The good news is that the object’s internal unmanaged resources will be freed one
way or another.</p>
<p>Here is the next iteration of MyResourceWrapper, which is now finalizable and disposable, defined in
a C# Console Application named FinalizableDisposableClass:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// A sophisticated resource wrapper.
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyResourceWrapper : IDisposable
{
    // The garbage collector will <span class="kwrd">call</span> this method <span class="kwrd">if</span> the
    // <span class="kwrd">object</span> user forgets <span class="kwrd">to</span> <span class="kwrd">call</span> Dispose().
    ~MyResourceWrapper()
    {
        // Clean up any internal unmanaged resources.
        // <span class="kwrd">Do</span> **<span class="kwrd">not</span>** <span class="kwrd">call</span> Dispose() <span class="kwrd">on</span> any managed objects.
    }

    // The <span class="kwrd">object</span> user will <span class="kwrd">call</span> this method <span class="kwrd">to</span> clean up
    // resources ASAP.
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> void Dispose()
    {
        // Clean up unmanaged resources here.
        // <span class="kwrd">Call</span> Dispose() <span class="kwrd">on</span> other contained disposable objects.
        
        // No need <span class="kwrd">to</span> finalize <span class="kwrd">if</span> user called Dispose(),
        // so suppress finalization.
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that this Dispose() method has been updated to call GC.SuppressFinalize(), which informs
the CLR that it is no longer necessary to call the destructor when this object is garbage-collected, given
that the unmanaged resources have already been freed via the Dispose() logic.</p>
<h2>A Formalized Disposal Pattern</h2>
<p>The current implementation of MyResourceWrapper does work fairly well; however, we are left with a few
minor drawbacks. First, the Finalize() and Dispose() methods each have to clean up the same
unmanaged resources. This could result in duplicate code, which can easily become a nightmare to
maintain. Ideally, you would define a private helper function that is called by either method.</p>
<p>Next, you’d like to make sure that the Finalize() method does not attempt to dispose of any
managed objects, while the Dispose() method should do so. Finally, you’d also like to be certain the
object user can safely call Dispose() multiple times without error. Currently, our Dispose() method has
no such safeguards.</p>
<p>To address these design issues, Microsoft defined a formal, prim-and-proper disposal pattern that
strikes a balance between robustness, maintainability, and performance. Here is the final (and
annotated) version of MyResourceWrapper, which makes use of this official pattern:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyResourceWrapper : IDisposable
{
    // Used <span class="kwrd">to</span> determine <span class="kwrd">if</span> Dispose()
    // has already been called.
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> bool disposed = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> void Dispose()
    {
        // <span class="kwrd">Call</span> our helper method.
        // Specifying <span class="str">"true"</span> signifies that
        // the <span class="kwrd">object</span> user triggered the cleanup.
        CleanUp(<span class="kwrd">true</span>);

        // Now suppress finalization.
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> void CleanUp(bool disposing)
    {
        // Be sure we have <span class="kwrd">not</span> already been disposed!
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (!this.disposed)
        {
            // <span class="kwrd">If</span> disposing equals <span class="kwrd">true</span>, dispose all
            // managed resources.
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (disposing)
            {
                // Dispose managed resources.
            }
            // Clean up unmanaged resources here.
        }
        disposed = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    }

    ~MyResourceWrapper()
    {
        // <span class="kwrd">Call</span> our helper method.
        // Specifying <span class="str">"false"</span> signifies that
        // the GC triggered the cleanup.
        CleanUp(<span class="kwrd">false</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that MyResourceWrapper now defines a private helper method named CleanUp(). By specifying
true as an argument, we indicate that the object user has initiated the cleanup, so we should clean up all
managed and unmanaged resources. However, when the garbage collector initiates the cleanup, we
specify false when calling CleanUp() to ensure that internal disposable objects are not disposed (as we
can’t assume they are still in memory!). Last but not least, our bool member variable (disposed) is set to
true before exiting CleanUp() to ensure that Dispose() can be called numerous times without error.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> After an object has been “disposed”, it’s still possible for the client to invoke members on it as it is still in
memory. Therefore, a robust resource wrapper class would also need to update each member of the class with
additional coding logic that says, in effect, “if I am disposed, do nothing and return from the member.”</p>
<p>To test our final iteration of MyResourceWrapper, add a call to Console.Beep() within the scope of
your finalizer:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
~MyResourceWrapper()
{
    Console.Beep();
    <span class="rem">// Call our helper method.</span>
    <span class="rem">// Specifying "false" signifies that</span>
    <span class="rem">// the GC triggered the cleanup.</span>
    CleanUp(<span class="kwrd">false</span>);
}</pre>
<p>Next, update Main() as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Dispose() / Destructor Combo Platter *****"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Call Dispose() manually, this will not call the finalizer.</span>
    MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper();
    rw.Dispose();

    <span class="rem">// Don't call Dispose(), this will trigger the finalizer</span>
    <span class="rem">// and cause a beep.</span>
    MyResourceWrapper rw2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that we are explicitly calling Dispose() on the rw object, so the destructor call is suppressed.
However, we have "forgotten" to call Dispose() on the rw2 object, and therefore, when the application
terminates, we hear a single beep. If you were to comment out the call to Dispose() on the rw object, you
would hear two beeps.</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The FinalizableDisposableClass project is included under the Chapter 8 subdirectory.</p>
<p>That concludes our investigation of how the CLR manages your objects via garbage collection. While
there are additional (somewhat esoteric) details regarding the collection process I haven’t covered here
(such as weak references and object resurrection), you are now in a perfect position for further
exploration on your own. To wrap this chapter up, we will examine a brand new .NET 4.0 programming
feature called “lazy instantiation” of objects.</p>
