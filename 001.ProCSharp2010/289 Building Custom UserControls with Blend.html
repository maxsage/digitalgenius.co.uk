<h1>Building Custom UserControls with Blend</h1>
    <p>During your examination of dependency properties, you were briefly introduced to the concept of a
. In some ways, a  is the next logical step after a control template. Recall that
when you build a control template, you are essentially applying a skin which changes the physical
appearance of a WPF control. A custom , however, allows you to literally build a new class
type that may contain unique members (methods, events, properties, etc.). As well, many custom
s use templates and styles; however, it is also just fine if the control’s tree of markup is
defined directly within the &lt;&gt; scope.</p>
<p>Recall that you can add a  project item to any Visual Studio 2010 WPF application,
including creating a  library project, which is a *.dll that contains nothing but a collection
of s to make use of across projects.</p>
<p>In this final section of the chapter, I will make use of Expression Blend to show you a few very
interesting development techniques, including creating a new control from a geometry, working with
the animation editor, and incorporating visual cues using the .NET 4.0 Visual State Manager (VSM).
While going through these topics, remember that you can certainly achieve the same end result if you
make use of Visual Studio 2010; it will just require more manually typing for the markup.</p>
<h2>Creating a  Library Project</h2>
<p>The goal for this final example of the chapter is to build a WPF application that represents a simple
jackpot game. While you could bundle all of the logic in a new WPF executable, you will instead place
your custom controls in a dedicated library project. Begin by launching Expression Blend, and from the
File | New Project menu create a new WPF Control Library project named MyCustomControl
(Figure 31-14).</p>

<h2>Renaming the Initial </h2>
<p>This project type will provide you with an initial  named MainControl. Let’s rename this
control to SpinControl. To do so, begin by changing the name of the MainControl.xaml file to
SpinControl.xaml via the Projects tab. Next, open the XAML editor for your initial control, and change
the x:Class attribute as shown here (also, delete the x:Name attribute completely). Then, set the Height
and Width of the  to 150 each:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">UserControl</span>
    <span class="attr">xmlns</span><span class="kwrd">="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"</span>
    <span class="attr">xmlns:x</span><span class="kwrd">="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"</span>

    <span class="attr">xmlns:mc</span><span class="kwrd">="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"</span>
    <span class="attr">mc:Ignorable</span><span class="kwrd">="d"</span>
    <span class="attr">x:Class</span><span class="kwrd">="MyCustomControl.SpinControl"</span>
    <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="150"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="150"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Grid</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">UserControl</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Last but not least, open the C# code file that is paired to your XAML document, and change the
name of this class (and the constructor) to SpinControl:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> SpinControl
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SpinControl()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.InitializeComponent();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, just for a sanity check, build your entire project just to ensure you don’t have any typos.</p>
<h2>Designing the SpinControl</h2>
<p>The purpose of the custom SpinControl is to cycle through three image files in a random manner
whenever the Spin() method is called. The downloadable code for this book includes three image files
(Cherries.png, Jackpot.jpg and Limes.jpg) which represent the possible images that could be displayed,
so feel free to add them to your current project using the Project | Add Existing Item… menu option.
When you add these images to your Blend project, they will automatically be configured to be embedded
into the resulting assembly.</p>
<p>The visual design of the SpinControl is quite simple. Using the Assets Library, include a Border
control which uses a BorderThickness value of 5, and using the Brushes editor, select a BorderBrush color
of your liking. Next, place an Image control (named imgDisplay) within the Grid, and set the Stretch
property to the value Fill. When you are done, the Grid should be configured similar to the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Grid</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="LayoutRoot"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Border</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="#FFD51919"</span> <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="5"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Image</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="imgDisplay"</span> <span class="attr">Margin</span><span class="kwrd">="8"</span> <span class="attr">Stretch</span><span class="kwrd">="Fill"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Grid</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Finally, set the Source property of the Image control to one of your three images. Your designer
should now look something like Figure 31-15.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_15.png" alt="Figure 31-15" />
<p><b>Figure 31-15</b> The UI of the SpinControl</p>
<h2>Adding the Initial C# Code</h2>
<p>Now that the markup is complete, use the Events tab of the Blend Properties window to handle the
Loaded event for your control, and specify a method named SpinControl_Loaded. In your code window,
declare an array of three BitmapImage objects that are filled with the embedded binary image files when
the Loaded event fires:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> SpinControl
{
    <span class="rem">// An array of BitmapImage objects.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> BitmapImage[] images = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BitmapImage[3];

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SpinControl()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.InitializeComponent();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SpinControl_Loaded(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Fill the ImageSource array with each image.</span>
        images[0] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BitmapImage(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"Cherries.png"</span>, UriKind.Relative));
        images[1] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BitmapImage(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"Jackpot.jpg"</span>, UriKind.Relative));
        images[2] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BitmapImage(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"Limes.jpg"</span>, UriKind.Relative));
    }
}</pre>
<p>Next, define a public method named Spin(), which is implemented to randomly show one of the
three BitmapImage objects in the Image control and return the value of the random number:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Spin()
{
    <span class="rem">// Randomly put one of the images into the Image control.</span>
    Random r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Random(DateTime.Now.Millisecond);
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> randomNumber = r.Next(3);
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.imgDisplay.Source = images[randomNumber];
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> randomNumber;
}</pre>
<h2>Defining an Animation using Blend</h2>
<p>Your SpinControl is almost complete; however, to make things more visual appealing to the user, you
will now use Blend to define an animation that will make the Image control appear to flip in a rotation in
order to give the illusion that the graphical image has spun. You could author some C# code which
preformed the animation logic; however, in this example, you will make use of the integrated animation
editor of Blend to define a XAML storyboard.</p>
<p>Ensure that the designer of your SpinControl is the active window in your project. Now, using the
Objects and Timeline editor, select your Image control, and then click on the "New Storyboard" button
(Figure 31-16).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_16.png" alt="Figure 31-16" />
<p><b>Figure 31-16</b> Creating a new Storyboard using Expression Blend</p>
<p>From the resulting dialog box, name your storyboard SpinImageStoryboard. Once you have clicked
the OK button, you will notice that the Objects and Timeline editor has changed its appearance.
Specifically, you’ll see a time line editor, which can be more easily viewed by pressing the F6 key to
arrange the IDE into animation editor mode (press F6 again to toggle back to the previous IDE layout).</p>
<p>This editor allows you to capture how an object will change over units of time called keyframes. To
begin, click the yellow arrow of the timeline and drag it to the 0.5 second mark. Once you have done so,
click the Record Keyframe button, which is located right above the zero second mark. When you are
done, your time line editor should look like Figure 31-17.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_17.png" alt="Figure 31-17" />
<p><b>Figure 31-17</b> Defining a new keyframe</p>
<p>You will also notice that your visual editor is now in record mode, signified by the red border around
the visual designer. You are free to now change any property of an object using the Properties editor.
While you are making changes, these are being recorded by the IDE and are written out as XAML
animation instructions. For this animation, locate the Transform editor in the Properties window of
Expression Blend, and pick the Flip Y Access option (Figure 31-18).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_18.png" alt="Figure 31-18" />
<p><b>Figure 31-18</b> Applying a transformation to the Image control</p>
<p>Now, go back to the Objects and Timeline editor, and click on your SpinImageStoryboard story board
resource (Figure 31-19).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_19.png" alt="Figure 31-19" />
    <p><b>Figure 31-19</b> Selecting the SpinImageStoryboard for editing</p>
<p>Once you select a story board for editing, you can configure various settings on the storyboard itself,
such as auto-reversing or repeat behaviors using the Properties editor. For your animation storyboard,
click the AutoReverse checkbox (Figure 31-20).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_20.png" alt="Figure 31-20" />
<p><b>Figure 31-20</b> Auto reversing your animation</p>
<p>At this point, you can test your animation! Just click the Play button (Figure 31-21). You should see
your image flip and then reverse back to the original upright display.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_21.png" alt="Figure 31-21" />
<p><b>Figure 31-21</b> Testing your animation</p>
<p>In summary, you have defined a simple animation which will take place over a total of 1 second (1/2
a second for the flipping of the image and an additional 1/2 a second to reverse the transformation). You
can now exit the animation editor by clicking on the recording button on your visual designer
(Figure 31-22).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_22.png" alt="Figure 31-22" />
    <p><b>Figure 31-22</b> Exiting the animation editor</p>
<p><b>Note</b> our animation only changed a single property of a single object. Note that a storyboard can change any
number of properties (for any number of objects) over various key frames. To do so, simply drag the yellow
timeline to a new unit of time, click the Add Keyframe button, and change properties on the object selected in
Objects and Timeline.</p>
<p>If you were to view the underlying XAML, you will see that Blend has added a new &lt;Storyboard&gt; to
your 's resource dictionary:</p>

    <h2>Programmatically Starting our Storyboard</h2>
<p>Before you move onto the construction of the WPF Application that will make use of your custom
button, you have a final task to attend to. By default, when you use the Blend animation editor, it will
add a trigger that will start your storyboard when the  (or Window, in the case of a WPF
application project) loads into memory:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">UserControl.Triggers</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">EventTrigger</span> <span class="attr">RoutedEvent</span><span class="kwrd">="FrameworkElement.Loaded"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">BeginStoryboard</span> <span class="attr">Storyboard</span><span class="kwrd">="{StaticResource SpinImageStoryboard}"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">EventTrigger</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">UserControl.Triggers</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>You can verify this by clicking on the Triggers editor (which can be opened via the Windows menu
of Expression Blend; see Figure 31-23).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure31_23.png" alt="Figure 31-23" />
<p><b>Figure 31-23</b> Deleting the automatically added trigger</p>
<p>In addition to spinning when the control loads, you will also spin when the Spin() method is called.
Import the System.Windows.Media.Animation namespace in your C# code file, and update your Spin()
method to invoke the story board like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Spin()
{
    <span class="rem">// Randomly put of the images into the Image control.</span>
    Random r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Random(DateTime.Now.Millisecond);
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> randomNumber = r.Next(3);
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.imgDisplay.Source = images[randomNumber];

    <span class="rem">// Start the storyboard animation!</span>
    ((Storyboard)Resources[<span class="str">"SpinImageStoryboard"</span>]).Begin();
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> randomNumber;
}</pre>
<p>That completes your custom control library! Go ahead and build your project to ensure you don’t
have any errors. Now let’s make use of this control from within a WPF Application.</p>
