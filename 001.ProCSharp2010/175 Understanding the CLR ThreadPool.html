<h1>Understanding the CLR ThreadPool</h1>
<p>The next thread-centric topic you will examine in this chapter is the role of the CLR thread pool. When
you invoke a method asynchronously using delegate types (via the BeginInvoke() method), the CLR does
not literally create a brand-new thread. For purposes of efficiency, a delegate’s BeginInvoke() method
leverages a pool of worker threads that is maintained by the runtime. To allow you to interact with this
pool of waiting threads, the System.Threading namespace provides the ThreadPool class type.</p>
<p>If you wish to queue a method call for processing by a worker thread in the pool, you can make use
of the ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem() method. This method has been overloaded to allow you to
specify an optional System.Object for custom state data in addition to an instance of the WaitCallback
delegate:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ThreadPool
{
    ...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback callBack);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> QueueUserWorkItem(WaitCallback callBack,
        <span class="kwrd">object</span> state);
}</pre>
<p>The WaitCallback delegate can point to any method that takes a System.Object as its sole parameter
(which represents the optional state data) and returns nothing. Do note that if you do not provide a
System.Object when calling QueueUserWorkItem(), the CLR automatically passes a null value. To
illustrate queuing methods for use by the CLR thread pool, ponder the following program, which makes
use of the Printer type once again. In this case, however, you are not manually creating an array of
Thread objects; rather, you are assigning members of the pool to the PrintNumbers() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with the CLR Thread Pool *****\n"</span>);

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Main thread started. ThreadID = {0}"</span>,
            Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);

        Printer p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Printer();

        WaitCallback workItem = <span class="kwrd">new</span> WaitCallback(PrintTheNumbers);

        <span class="rem">// Queue the method ten times.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(workItem, p);
        }
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"All tasks queued"</span>);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintTheNumbers(<span class="kwrd">object</span> state)
    {    
        Printer task = (Printer)state;
        task.PrintNumbers();
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering if it would be advantageous to make use of the CLR-maintained
thread pool rather than explicitly creating Thread objects. Consider these benefits of leveraging the
thread pool:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The thread pool manages threads efficiently by minimizing the number of threads
that must be created, started, and stopped.</li>
 <li>By using the thread pool, you can focus on your business problem rather than the
application’s threading infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, using manual thread management is preferred in some cases, for example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>If you require foreground threads or must set the thread priority. Pooled threads are always
background threads with default priority (ThreadPriority.Normal).</li>
 <li><p>If you require a thread with a fixed identity in order to abort it, suspend it, or
discover it by name.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>That wraps up your investigation of the System.Threading namespace. While you can use this
information to build some responsive applications, the remainder of this chapter will examine a new
addition to the base class libraries brought forth with .NET 4.0- The Task Parallel Library.</p>
