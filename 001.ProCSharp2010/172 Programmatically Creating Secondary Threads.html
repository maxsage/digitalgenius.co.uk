<h1>Programmatically Creating Secondary Threads</h1>
<p>When you wish to programmatically create additional threads to carry on some unit of work, you will
follow a very predictable process:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Create a method to be the entry point for the new thread.</li>
 <li>Create a new ParameterizedThreadStart (or ThreadStart) delegate, passing the
address of the method defined in step 1 to the constructor.</li>
 <li>Create a Thread object, passing the ParameterizedThreadStart/ThreadStart
delegate as a constructor argument.</li>
 <li>Establish any initial thread characteristics (name, priority, etc.).</li>
 <li>Call the Thread.Start() method. This starts the thread at the method
referenced by the delegate created in step 2 as soon as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>As stated in step 2, you may make use of two distinct delegate types to “point to” the method that
the secondary thread will execute. The ThreadStart delegate has been part of the System.Threading
namespace since .NET 1.0, and it can point to any method that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
This delegate can be helpful when the method is designed to simply run in the background without
further interaction.</p>
<p>The obvious limitation of ThreadStart is that you are unable to pass in parameters for processing.
However, the ParameterizedThreadStart delegate type allows a single parameter of type System.Object.
Given that anything can be represented as a System.Object, you can pass in any number of parameters
via a custom class or structure. Do note, however, that the ParameterizedThreadStart delegate can only
point to methods that return void.</p>
<h2>Working with the ThreadStart Delegate</h2>
<p>To illustrate the process of building a multithreaded application (as well as to demonstrate the
usefulness of doing so), assume you have a Console Application (SimpleMultiThreadApp) that allows the
end user to choose whether the application will perform its duties using the single primary thread or
split its workload using two separate threads of execution.</p>
<p>Assuming you have imported the System.Threading namespace, your first step is to define a method
to perform the work of the (possible) secondary thread. To keep focused on the mechanics of building
multithreaded programs, this method will simply print out a sequence of numbers to the console
window, pausing for approximately two seconds with each pass. Here is the full definition of the Printer
class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Printer
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintNumbers()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Display Thread info.</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; {0} is executing PrintNumbers()"</span>,
            Thread.CurrentThread.Name);

        <span class="rem">// Print out numbers.</span>
        Console.Write(<span class="str">"Your numbers: "</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">for</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        {
            Console.Write(<span class="str">"{0}, "</span>, i);
            Thread.Sleep(2000);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, within Main(), you will first prompt the user to determine whether one or two threads will be
used to perform the application’s work. If the user requests a single thread, you will simply invoke the
PrintNumbers() method within the primary thread. However, if the user specifies two threads, you will
create a ThreadStart delegate that points to PrintNumbers(), pass this delegate object into the
constructor of a new Thread object, and call Start() to inform the CLR this thread is ready for
processing.</p>
<p>To begin, set a reference to the System.Windows.Forms.dll assembly (and import the
System.Windows.Forms namespace) and display a message within Main() using MessageBox.Show() (you’ll
see the point of doing so once you run the program). Here is the complete implementation of Main():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** The Amazing Thread App *****\n"</span>);
    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Do you want [1] or [2] threads? "</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> threadCount = Console.ReadLine();

    <span class="rem">// Name the current thread.</span>
    Thread primaryThread = Thread.CurrentThread;
    primaryThread.Name = <span class="str">"Primary"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Display Thread info.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; {0} is executing Main()"</span>,
    Thread.CurrentThread.Name);

    <span class="rem">// Make worker class.</span>
    Printer p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Printer();

    <span class="kwrd">switch</span>(threadCount)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> <span class="str">"2"</span>:
            <span class="rem">// Now make the thread.</span>
            Thread backgroundThread =
                <span class="kwrd">new</span> Thread(<span class="kwrd">new</span> ThreadStart(p.PrintNumbers));
            backgroundThread.Name = <span class="str">"Secondary"</span>;
            backgroundThread.Start();
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> <span class="str">"1"</span>:
            p.PrintNumbers();
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">default</span>:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"I don't know what you want...you get 1 thread."</span>);
            <span class="kwrd">goto</span> <span class="kwrd">case</span> <span class="str">"1"</span>;
    }
    
    <span class="rem">// Do some additional work.</span>
    MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"I'm busy!"</span>, <span class="str">"Work on main thread..."</span>);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Now, if you run this program with a single thread, you will find that the final message box will not
display the message until the entire sequence of numbers has printed to the console. As you are
explicitly pausing for approximately two seconds after each number is printed, this will result in a lessthan-
stellar end-user experience. However, if you select two threads, the message box displays instantly,
given that a unique Thread object is responsible for printing out the numbers to the console (see
Figure 19-2).</p>

<h2>Working with the ParameterizedThreadStart Delegate</h2>
<p>Recall that the ThreadStart delegate can point only to methods that return void and take no arguments.
While this may fit the bill in many cases, if you wish to pass data to the method executing on the
secondary thread, you will need to make use of the ParameterizedThreadStart delegate type. To
illustrate, let’s re-create the logic of the AsyncCallbackDelegate project created earlier in this chapter,
this time making use of the ParameterizedThreadStart delegate type.</p>
<p>To begin, create a new Console Application named AddWithThreads and import the
System.Threading namespace. Now, given that ParameterizedThreadStart can point to any method
taking a System.Object parameter, you will create a custom type containing the numbers to be added:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> AddParams
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> a, b;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> AddParams(<span class="kwrd">int</span> numb1, <span class="kwrd">int</span> numb2)
    {
        a = numb1;
        b = numb2;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Next, create a static method in the Program class that will take an AddParams parameter and print out
the sum of the two numbers involved:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">object</span> data)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (data <span class="kwrd">is</span> AddParams)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID of thread in Add(): {0}"</span>,
            Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        AddParams ap = (AddParams)data;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} + {1} is {2}"</span>,
            ap.a, ap.b, ap.a + ap.b);
    }
}</pre>
<p>The code within Main() is straightforward. Simply use ParameterizedThreadStart rather than
ThreadStart:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Adding with Thread objects *****"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID of thread in Main(): {0}"</span>,
        Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);

    <span class="rem">// Make an AddParams object to pass to the secondary thread.</span>
    AddParams ap = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AddParams(10, 10);
    Thread t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Thread(<span class="kwrd">new</span> ParameterizedThreadStart(Add));
    t.Start(ap);

    <span class="rem">// Force a wait to let other thread finish.</span>
    Thread.Sleep(5);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>The AutoResetEvent Class</h2>
<p>In these first few examples, you have made use of a few crude ways to inform the primary thread to wait
until the secondary thread has completed. During your examination of asynchronous delegates you
used a simple bool variable as a toggle; however, this is not a recommended solution, as both threads
can access the same point of data, and this can lead to data corruption. A safer, but still undesirable
alternative is to call Thread.Sleep() for a fixed amount of time. The problem here is you don’t want to
wait longer than necessary.</p>
<p>One simple, and thread safe way to force a thread to wait until another is completed is to use the
AutoResetEvent class. In the thread which needs to wait (such as a Main() method), create an instance of
this class, and pass in false to the constructor in order to signify you have not yet been notified. Then, at
the point at which you are willing to wait, call the WaitOne() method. Here is the update to Program class
which will do this very thing using a static level AutoResetEvent member variable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> AutoResetEvent waitHandle = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoResetEvent(<span class="kwrd">false</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Adding with Thread objects *****"</span>);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID of thread in Main(): {0}"</span>,
            Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
    
        AddParams ap = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AddParams(10, 10);
        Thread t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Thread(<span class="kwrd">new</span> ParameterizedThreadStart(Add));
        t.Start(ap);

        <span class="rem">// Wait here until you are notified!</span>
        waitHandle.WaitOne();
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Other thread is done!"</span>);

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>When the other thread is completed with its workload, it will call the Set() method on the same
instance of the AutoResetEvent type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">object</span> data)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (data <span class="kwrd">is</span> AddParams)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID of thread in Add(): {0}"</span>,
            Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);

        AddParams ap = (AddParams)data;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} + {1} is {2}"</span>,
            ap.a, ap.b, ap.a + ap.b);

        <span class="rem">// Tell other thread we are done.</span>
        waitHandle.Set();
    }
}</pre>

<h2>Foreground Threads and Background Threads</h2>
<p>Now that you have seen how to programmatically create new threads of execution using the
System.Threading namespace, let’s formalize the distinction between foreground threads and
background threads.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Foreground threads have the ability to prevent the current application from
terminating. The CLR will not shut down an application (which is to say, unload
the hosting AppDomain) until all foreground threads have ended.</li>
 <li>Background threads (sometimes called daemon threads) are viewed by the CLR as
expendable paths of execution that can be ignored at any point in time (even if
they are currently laboring over some unit of work). Thus, if all foreground threads
have terminated, any and all background threads are automatically killed when
the application domain unloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that foreground and background threads are not synonymous with primary
and worker threads. By default, every thread you create via the Thread.Start() method is automatically
a foreground thread. Again, this means that the AppDomain will not unload until all threads of execution
have completed their units of work. In most cases, this is exactly the behavior you require.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, however, assume that you wish to invoke Printer.PrintNumbers() on a
secondary thread that should behave as a background thread. Again, this means that the method
pointed to by the Thread type (via the ThreadStart or ParameterizedThreadStart delegate) should be able
to halt safely as soon as all foreground threads are done with their work. Configuring such a thread is as
simple as setting the IsBackground property to true:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Background Threads *****\n"</span>);

    Printer p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Printer();
    Thread bgroundThread =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> Thread(<span class="kwrd">new</span> ThreadStart(p.PrintNumbers));

    <span class="rem">// This is now a background thread.</span>
    bgroundThread.IsBackground = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    bgroundThread.Start();
}</pre>
<p>Notice that this Main() method is not making a call to Console.ReadLine() to force the console to
remain visible until you press the Enter key. Thus, when you run the application, it will shut down
immediately because the Thread object has been configured as a background thread. Given that the
Main() method triggers the creation of the primary foreground thread, as soon as the logic in Main()
completes, the AppDomain unloads before the secondary thread is able to complete its work.</p>
<p>However, if you comment out the line that sets the IsBackground property, you will find that each
number prints to the console, as all foreground threads must finish their work before the AppDomain is
unloaded from the hosting process.</p>
<p>For the most part, configuring a thread to run as a background type can be helpful when the worker
thread in question is performing a noncritical task that is no longer needed when the main task of the
program is finished. For example, you may build an application which pings an e-mail server every few
minutes for new e-mails, updates current weather conditions, or some other non-critical task.</p>
