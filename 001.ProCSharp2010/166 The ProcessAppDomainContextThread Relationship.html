<h1>The Process/AppDomain/Context/Thread Relationship</h1>
<p>In Chapter 16, a thread was defined as a path of execution within an executable application. While many
.NET applications can live happy and productive single-threaded lives, an assembly’s primary thread
(spawned by the CLR when Main() executes) may create secondary threads of execution to perform
additional units of work. By implementing additional threads, you can build more responsive (but not
necessarily faster executing on single-core machines) applications.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> These days it is quite common for new computers to make use of multicore processors (or at very least a
hyperthreaded single-core processor). Without making use of multiple threads, developers are unable to exploit
the full power of multicore machines.</p>
<p>The System.Threading namespace contains various types that allow you to create multithreaded
applications. The Thread class is perhaps the core type, as it represents a given thread. If you wish to
programmatically obtain a reference to the thread currently executing a given member, simply call the
static Thread.CurrentThread property:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExtractExecutingThread()
{
    <span class="rem">// Get the thread currently</span>
    <span class="rem">// executing this method.</span>
    Thread currThread = Thread.CurrentThread;
}</pre>
<p>Under the .NET platform, there is not a direct one-to-one correspondence between application
domains and threads. In fact, a given AppDomain can have numerous threads executing within it at any
given time. Furthermore, a particular thread is not confined to a single application domain during its
lifetime. Threads are free to cross application domain boundaries as the Windows thread scheduler and
CLR see fit.</p>
<p>Although active threads can be moved between AppDomain boundaries, a given thread can execute
within only a single application domain at any point in time (in other words, it is impossible for a single
thread to be doing work in more than one AppDomain at once). When you wish to programmatically
gain access to the AppDomain that is hosting the current thread, call the static Thread.GetDomain()
method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExtractAppDomainHostingThread()
{
    <span class="rem">// Obtain the AppDomain hosting the current thread.</span>
    AppDomain ad = Thread.GetDomain();
}</pre>
<p>A single thread may also be moved into a particular context at any given time, and it may be
relocated within a new context at the whim of the CLR. When you wish to obtain the current context a
thread happens to be executing in, make use of the static Thread.CurrentContext property (which
returns a System.Runtime.Remoting.Contexts.Context object):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExtractCurrentThreadContext()
{
    <span class="rem">// Obtain the context under which the</span>
    <span class="rem">// current thread is operating.</span>
    Context ctx = Thread.CurrentContext;
}</pre>
<p>Again, the CLR is the entity that is in charge of moving threads into (and out of) application domains
and contexts. As a .NET developer, you can usually remain blissfully unaware where a given thread ends
up (or exactly when it is placed into its new boundary). Nevertheless, you should be aware of the various
ways of obtaining the underlying primitives.</p>
<h2>The Problem of Concurrency</h2>
<p>One of the many “joys” (read: painful aspects) of multithreaded programming is that you have little
control over how the underlying operating system or the CLR makes use of its threads. For example, if
you craft a block of code that creates a new thread of execution, you cannot guarantee that the thread
executes immediately. Rather, such code only instructs the OS to execute the thread as soon as possible
(which is typically when the thread scheduler gets around to it).</p>
<p>Furthermore, given that threads can be moved between application and contextual boundaries as
required by the CLR, you must be mindful of which aspects of your application are thread-volatile (e.g.,
subject to multithreaded access) and which operations are atomic (thread-volatile operations are the
dangerous ones!).</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, assume a thread is invoking a method of a specific object. Now assume
that this thread is instructed by the thread scheduler to suspend its activity, in order to allow another
thread to access the same method of the same object.</p>
<p>If the original thread was not completely finished with its operation, the second incoming thread
may be viewing an object in a partially modified state. At this point, the second thread is basically
reading bogus data, which is sure to give way to extremely odd (and very hard to find) bugs, which are
even harder to replicate and debug.</p>
<p>Atomic operations, on the other hand, are always safe in a multithreaded environment. Sadly, there
are very few operations in the .NET base class libraries that are guaranteed to be atomic. Even the act of
assigning a value to a member variable is not atomic! Unless the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation
specifically says an operation is atomic, you must assume it is thread-volatile and take precautions.</p>
<h2>The Role of Thread Synchronization</h2>
<p>At this point, it should be clear that multithreaded application domains are in themselves quite volatile,
as numerous threads can operate on the shared resources at (more or less) the same time. To protect an
application’s resources from possible corruption, .NET developers must make use of any number of
threading primitives (such as locks, monitors, and the [Synchronization] attribute) to control access
among the executing threads.</p>
<p>Although the .NET platform cannot make the difficulties of building robust multithreaded
applications completely disappear, the process has been simplified considerably. Using types defined
within the System.Threading namespace, and the .NET 4.0 Task Parallel Library (TPL), you are able to
spawn additional threads with minimal fuss and bother. Likewise, when it is time to lock down shared
points of data, you will find additional types that provide the same functionality as the Windows API
threading primitives (using a much cleaner object model).</p>
<p>Before diving into the System.Threading namespace and the TPL, it is important to note that there is
one other useful way to incorporate threads into an application. During the examination of the .NET
delegate (see Chapter 11), it was mentioned that all delegates have the ability to invoke members
asynchronously. This is a major benefit of the .NET platform, given that one of the most common
reasons a developer creates threads is for the purpose of invoking methods in a nonblocking (a.k.a.
asynchronous) manner.</p>
