<h1>Understanding CIL Directives and Attributes</h1>
<p>Now that you have seen how ildasm.exe and ilasm.exe can be used to perform a round-trip, you can get
down to the business of checking out the syntax and semantics of CIL itself. The next sections will walk
you through the process of authoring a custom namespace containing a set of types. However, to keep
things simple, these types will not contain any implementation logic for their members (yet). Once you
understand how to create empty types, you can then turn your attention to the process of defining “real”
members using CIL opcodes.</p>
<h2>Specifying Externally Referenced Assemblies in CIL</h2>
<p>Create a new file named CilTypes.il using your editor of choice. The first task a CIL project will require
is to list the set of external assemblies used by the current assembly. For this example, you will only
make use of types found within mscorlib.dll. To do so, the .assembly directive will be qualified using
the external attribute. When you are referencing a strongly named assembly, such as mscorlib.dll,
you’ll want to specify the .publickeytoken and .ver directives as well:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.assembly extern mscorlib
{
    .publickeytoken = (B7 7A 5C 56 19 34 E0 89 )
    .ver 4:0:0:0
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> Strictly speaking, you are not required to explicitly reference mscorlib.dll as an external reference, as
ilasm.exe will do so automatically. However, for each external .NET library your CIL project requires, you will
need to author a similar .assembly extern directive.</p>
<h2>Defining the Current Assembly in CIL</h2>
<p>The next order of business is to define the assembly you are interested in building using the .assembly
directive. At the simplest level, an assembly can be defined by specifying the friendly name of the binary:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Our assembly.
.assembly CILTypes { }
</pre>
<p>While this indeed defines a new .NET assembly, you will typically place additional directives within
the scope of the assembly declaration. For this example, update your assembly definition to include a
version number of 1.0.0.0 using the .ver directive (note that each numerical identifier is separated by
colons, not the C#-centric dot notation):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Our assembly.
.assembly CILTypes
{
    .ver 1:0:0:0
}</pre>
<p>Given that the CILTypes assembly is a single-file assembly, you will finish up the assembly
-definition using a single .module directive, which marks the official name of your .NET binary,
CILTypes.dll:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.assembly CILTypes
{
    .ver 1:0:0:0
}
// The module of our single-file assembly.
.module CILTypes.dll
</pre>
<p>In addition to .assembly and .module are CIL directives that further qualify the overall structure of
the .NET binary you are composing. Table 17-2 lists a few of the more common assembly-level
directives.</p>
<p><b>Table 17-2.</b> Additional Assembly-Centric Directives</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <td>
    Directive
   </td>
   <td>
    Meaning in Life
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    .mresources
   </td>
   <td>
    If your assembly makes use of internal resources (such as bitmaps or string
tables), this directive is used to identify the name of the file that contains the
resources to be embedded.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    .subsystem
   </td>
   <td>
    This CIL directive is used to establish the preferred UI that the assembly
wishes to execute within. For example, a value of 2 signifies that the assembly
should run within a GUI application, whereas a value of 3 denotes a console
executable.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Defining Namespaces in CIL</h2>
<p>Now that you have defined the look and feel of your assembly (and the required external references), you
can create a .NET namespace (MyNamespace) using the .namespace directive:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Our assembly has a single namespace.
.namespace MyNamespace {}</pre>
<p>Like C#, CIL namespace definitions can be nested within further namespaces. There is no need to
define a root namespace here; however, for the sake of argument, assume you wish to create a root
namespace named MyCompany:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.namespace MyCompany
{
.namespace MyNamespace {}
}
</pre>
<p>Like C#, CIL allows you to define a nested namespace as follows:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Defining a nested namespace.
.namespace MyCompany.MyNamespace{}
</pre>
<h2>Defining Class Types in CIL</h2>
<p>Empty namespaces are not very interesting, so let’s now check out the process of defining a class type
using CIL. Not surprisingly, the .class directive is used to define a new class. However, this simple
directive can be adorned with numerous additional attributes, to further qualify the nature of the type.
To illustrate, add a public class to your namespace named MyBaseClass. As in C#, if you do not specify an
explicit base class, your type will automatically be derived from System.Object.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.namespace MyNamespace
{
    // System.Object base class assumed.
    .class public MyBaseClass {}
}</pre>
<p>When you are building a class type that derives from any class other than System.Object, you make
use of the extends attribute. Whenever you need to reference a type defined within the same assembly,
CIL demands that you also make use of the fully qualified name (however, if the base type is within the
same assembly, you can omit the assembly’s friendly name prefix). Therefore, the following attempt to
extend MyBaseClass results in a compiler error:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// This will not compile!
.namespace MyNamespace
{
    .class public MyBaseClass {}

    .class public MyDerivedClass
        extends MyBaseClass {}
}</pre>
<p>To correctly define the parent class of MyDerivedClass, you must specify the full name of
MyBaseClass as follows:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Better!
.namespace MyNamespace
{
    .class public MyBaseClass {}

    .class public MyDerivedClass
        extends MyNamespace.MyBaseClass {}
}</pre>
<p>In addition to the public and extends attributes, a CIL class definition may take numerous
additional qualifiers that control the type’s visibility, field layout, and so on. Table 17-3 illustrates some
(but not all) of the attributes that may be used in conjunction with the .class directive.</p>
<p><b>Table 17-3.</b> Various Attributes Used in Conjunction with the .class Directive</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Attributes
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    public, private, nested assembly,
nested famandassem, nested family,
nested famorassem, nested public,
nested private
   </td>
   <td>
    CIL defines various attributes that are used to specify the
visibility of a given type. As you can see, raw CIL offers
numerous possibilities other than those offered by C#. Refer
to ECMA 335 for details if you are interested.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    abstract, sealed
   </td>
   <td>
    These two attributes may be tacked onto a .class directive to
define an abstract class or sealed class, respectively.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    auto, sequential, explicit
   </td>
   <td>
    These attributes are used to instruct the CLR how to lay out
field data in memory. For class types, the default layout flag
(auto) is appropriate. Changing this default can be helpful if
you need to use P/Invoke to call into unmanaged C code.
   </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
   <td>
    extends, implements
   </td>
   <td>
    These attributes allow you to define the base class of a type (via
extends) or implement an interface on a type (via implements).
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Defining and Implementing Interfaces in CIL</h2>
<p>As odd as it may seem, interface types are defined in CIL using the .class directive. However, when the
.class directive is adorned with the interface attribute, the type is realized as a CTS interface type.
Once an interface has been defined, it may be bound to a class or structure type using the CIL
implements attribute:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.namespace MyNamespace
{
	// An interface definition.
	.class public interface IMyInterface {}

	// A simple base class.
	.class public MyBaseClass {}

	// MyDerivedClass now implements IMyInterface,
	// and extends MyBaseClass.
	.class public MyDerivedClass
		extends MyNamespace.MyBaseClass
		implements MyNamespace.IMyInterface {}
}
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> The extends clause must precede the implements clause. As well, the implements can incorporate a
comma-separated list of interfaces.</p>
<p>As you recall from Chapter 9, interfaces can function as the base interface to other interface types in
order to build interface hierarchies. However, contrary to what you might be thinking, the extends
attribute cannot be used to derive interface A from interface B. The extends attribute is used only to
qualify a type’s base class. When you wish to extend an interface, you will make use of the implements
attribute yet again:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Extending interfaces in terms of CIL.
.class public interface IMyInterface {}

.class public interface IMyOtherInterface
    implements MyNamespace.IMyInterface {}
</pre>
 <h2>Defining Structures in CIL</h2>
 <p>The .class directive can be used to define a CTS structure if the type extends System.ValueType. As well,
the .class directive must be qualified with the sealed attribute (given that structures can never be a base
structure to other value types). If you attempt to do otherwise, ilasm.exe will issue a compiler error.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// A structure definition is always sealed.
.class public sealed MyStruct
extends [mscorlib]System.ValueType{}</pre>
<p>Do be aware that CIL provides a shorthand notation to define a structure type. If you use the value
attribute, the new type will derive the type from [mscorlib]System.ValueType automatically. Therefore,
you could define MyStruct as follows:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Shorthand notation for declaring a structure.
.class public sealed value MyStruct{}
</pre>
<h2>Defining Enums in CIL</h2>
<p>.NET enumerations (as you recall) derive from System.Enum, which is a System.ValueType (and therefore
must also be sealed). When you wish to define an enum in terms of CIL, simply extend
[mscorlib]System.Enum:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// An enum.
    .class public sealed MyEnum
        extends [mscorlib]System.Enum{}
</pre>
 <p>Like a structure definition, enumerations can be defined with a shorthand notation using the enum
attribute:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Enum shorthand.
.class public sealed enum MyEnum{}
</pre>
<p>You’ll see how to specify the name/value pairs of an enumeration in just a moment.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The other fundamental .NET type, the delegate, also has a specific CIL representation. See Chapter 11 for details.</p>
<h2>Defining Generics in CIL</h2>
<p>Generic types also have a specific representation in the syntax of CIL. Recall from Chapter 10 that a given
generic type or generic member may have one or more type parameters. For example, the List&lt;T&gt; type
has a single type parameter, while Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; has two. In terms of CIL, the number of
type parameters is specified using a backward-leaning single tick, `, followed by a numerical value
representing the number of type parameters. Like C#, the actual value of the type parameters is encased
within angled brackets.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> On most keyboards, the ` character can be found on the key above the Tab key (and to the left of the 1 key).</p>
<p>For example, assume you wish to create a List&lt;T&gt; variable, where T is of type System.Int32. In CIL,
you would author the following (which could appear in any CIL method scope):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// In C#: List&lt;int&gt; myInts = new List&lt;int&gt;();
newobj instance void class [mscorlib]
    System.Collections.Generic.List`1&lt;int32&gt;::.ctor()
</pre>
 <p>Notice that this generic class is defined as List`1&lt;int32&gt;, as List&lt;T&gt; has a single type parameter.
However, if you needed to define a Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;type, you would do so as the following:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// In C#: Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt; d = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
newobj instance void class [mscorlib]
System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2&lt;string,int32&gt;::.ctor()</pre>
 <p>As another example, if you have a generic type that uses another generic type as a type parameter,
you would author CIL code such as the following:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// In C#: List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt; myInts = new List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt;();
newobj instance void class [mscorlib]
    System.Collections.Generic.List`1&lt;class
        [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.List`1&lt;int32&gt;&gt;::.ctor()
</pre>
 <h2>Compiling the CILTypes.il file</h2> 
 <p>Even though you have not yet added any members or implementation code to the types you have
defined, you are able to compile this *.il file into a .NET DLL assembly (which you must do, as you have
not specified a Main() method). Open up a command prompt and enter the following command to
ilasm.exe:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">ilasm /dll CilTypes.il</pre>
<p>Once you have done so, you are able to open your binary into ildasm.exe (see Figure 17-3).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure17_03.png" alt="Figure 17-3" />
<p><b>Figure 17-3</b> The CILTypes.dll assembly</p>
<p>Once you have confirmed the contents of your assembly, run peverify.exe against it:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
peverify CilTypes.dll</pre>
<p>Notice that you are issued errors, given that all your types are completely empty. Here is some
partial output:</p>

<p>To understand how to populate a type with content, you first need to examine the fundamental data
types of CIL.</p>
