<h1>Introducing the Documents API</h1>
<p>WPF ships with many controls that allow you to capture or display simple blurbs of textual data,
including Label, TextBox, TextBlock, and PasswordBox. These controls are useful, but some WPF
applications require the use of sophisticated, highly formatted text data, similar to what you might find
in an Adobe PDF file. The Documents API of WPF provides such functionality; however, it uses the XML
Paper Specification (XPS) format rather than the PDF file format .</p>
<p>You can use the Documents API to construct a print-ready document by leveraging several classes
from the System.Windows.Documents namespace. Here you will find a number of types that represent
pieces of a rich XPS document, such as List, Paragraph, Section, Table, LineBreak, Figure, Floater, and
Span.</p>
<h2>Block Elements and Inline Elements</h2>
<p>Formally speaking, the items you add to a XPS document belong to one of two broad categories: block
elements and inline elements. This first category, block elements, consists of classes that extend the
System.Windows.Documents.Block base class. Examples of block elements include List, Paragraph,
BlockUIContainer, Section, and Table. You use classes from this category to group together other
content (e.g., a list containing paragraph data, and a paragraph containing sub paragraphs for different
text formatting).</p>
<p>The second category, inline elements, consists of classes that extend the
System.Windows.Documents.Inline base class. You nest inline elements within another block item (or
possibly within another inline element inside a block element). Some common inline elements include
Run, Span, LineBreak, Figure, and Floater.</p>
<p>These classes possess names that you might encounter when building a rich document with a
professional editor. As with any other WPF control, you can configure these classes in XAML or through
code. Therefore, you can declare an empty &lt;Paragraph&gt; element that is populated at runtime (you’ll see
how to do such tasks in this example).</p>
<h2>Document Layout Managers</h2>
<p>You might think you can simply place inline and block elements directly into a panel container such as a
Grid; however, you need to wrap them in a &lt;FlowDocument&gt; element or a &lt;FixedDocument&gt; element.</p>
<p>It is ideal to place items in a FlowDocument when you wish to let your end user change the way the
data is presented on the computer screen. The user can do this by zooming text or changing how the
data is presented (e.g., a single long page or a pair of columns). You’re better off using FixedDocument for
true print-ready (WYSIWYG), unchangeable document data.</p>
<p>For this example, you will only concern yourself with the FlowDocument container. Once you insert
inline and block items to your FlowDocument, the FlowDocument object is placed in one of four specialized
XPS-aware layout managers, listed in Table 28-4.</p>
<p><b>Table 28-4.</b> XPS Control Layout Managers</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Panel Control
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    FlowDocumentReader
   </td>
   <td>
    Displays data in a FlowDocument and adds support for zooming,
searching, and content layout in various forms.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    FlowDocumentScrollViewer
   </td>
   <td>
    Displays data in a FlowDocument; however, the data is presented as a
single document viewed with scrollbars. This container does not
support zooming, searching, or alternative layout modes.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    RichTextBox
   </td>
   <td>
    Displays data in a FlowDocument and adds support for user editing.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    FlowDocumentPageViewer
   </td>
   <td>
    Displays the document page-by-page, one page at a time. Data can also
be zoomed, but not searched.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The most feature-rich way to display a FlowDocument is to wrap it within a FlowDocumentReader
manager. When you do this, the user can alter the layout, search for words in the document, and zoom
in on the data using the provided UI. The one limitation of this container (as well as of
FlowDocumentScrollViewer and FlowDocumentPageViewer) is that the content you display with it is read
only. However, if you do want to allow the end user to enter new information to the FlowDocument, you
can wrap it in a RichTextBox control.</p>
