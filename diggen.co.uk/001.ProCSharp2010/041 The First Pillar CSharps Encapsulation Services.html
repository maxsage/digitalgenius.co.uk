    <h1>The First Pillar: C#'s Encapsulation Services</h1>
    <p>The concept of encapsulation revolves around the notion that an object's internal data should not be
    directly accessible from an object instance. Rather, if the caller wants to alter the state of an object, the
    user does so indirectly using accessor (i.e., "getter") and mutator (i.e., "setter") methods. In C#,
    encapsulation is enforced at the syntactic level using the public, private, internal, and protected
    keywords. To illustrate the need for encapsulation services, assume you have created the following class
    definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A class with a single public field.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Book
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> numberOfPages;
}</pre>
    <p>The problem with public data is that the data itself has no ability to "understand" whether the
    current value to which they are assigned is valid with regard to the current business rules of the system.
    As you know, the upper range of a C# int is quite large (2,147,483,647). Therefore, the compiler allows
    the following assignment:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Humm. That is one heck of a mini-novel!</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Book miniNovel = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Book();
    miniNovel.numberOfPages = 30000000;
}</pre>
    <p>Although you have not overflowed the boundaries of an int data type, it should be clear that a mininovel
    with a page count of 30,000,000 pages is a bit unreasonable. As you can see, public fields do not
    provide a way to trap logical upper (or lower) limits. If your current system has a business rule that states
    a book must be between 1 and 1,000 pages, you are at a loss to enforce this programmatically. Because of
    this, public fields typically have no place in a production-level class definition.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> To be more specific, members of a class that represent an object's state should not be marked as public.
    As you will see later in this chapter, public constants and public read-only fields are a-okay.</p>
    <p>Encapsulation provides a way to preserve the integrity of an object's state data. Rather than defining
    public fields (which can easily foster data corruption), you should get in the habit of defining private
    data, which is indirectly manipulated using one of two main techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define a pair of accessor (get) and mutator (set) methods.</li>
        <li>Define a .NET property.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whichever technique you choose, the point is that a well-encapsulated class should protect its data
    and hide the details of how it operates from the prying eyes of the outside world. This is often termed
    black box programming. The beauty of this approach is that an object is free to change how a given
    method is implemented under the hood. It does this without breaking any existing code making use of it,
    provided that the parameters and return values of the method remain constant.</p>
    <h2>Encapsulation Using Traditional Accessors and Mutators</h2>
    <p>Over the remaining pages in this chapter, you will be building a fairly complete class that models a
    general employee. To get the ball rolling, create a new Console Application named EmployeeApp and
    insert a new class file (named Employee.cs) using the Project ? Add class menu item. Update the
    Employee class with the following fields, methods, and constructors:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// Field data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> empName;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay;

    <span class="rem">// Constructors.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Employee() {}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Employee(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">float</span> pay)
    {
        empName = name;
        empID = id;
        currPay = pay;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Methods.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
        currPay += amount;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayStats()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Name: {0}"</span>, empName);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID: {0}"</span>, empID);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Pay: {0}"</span>, currPay);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that the fields of the Employee class are currently defined using the private keyword. Given
    this, the empName, empID, and currPay fields are not directly accessible from an object variable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Error! Cannot directly access private members</span>
    <span class="rem">// from an object!</span>
    Employee emp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();
    emp.empName = <span class="str">"Marv"</span>;
}</pre>
    <p>If you want the outside world to interact with a worker's full name, tradition dictates defining an
    accessor (get method) and a mutator (set method). The role of a 'get' method is to return to the caller the
    current value of the underlying state data. A 'set' method allows the caller to change the current value of
    the underlying state data, so long as the defined business rules are met.</p>
    <p>To illustrate, let's encapsulate the empName field. To do so, add the following public methods to the
    Employee class. Notice that the SetName() method performs a test on the incoming data, to ensure the
    string is 15 characters or less. If it is not, an error prints to the console and returns without making a
    change to the empName field:</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> If this were a production level class, you would also make to check the character length for an employee's
    name within your constructor logic. Ignore this detail for the time being, you will clean up this code in just a bit
    when you examine .NET property syntax.</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee

    ...
    <span class="rem">// Accessor (get method)</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> GetName()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> empName;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Mutator (set method)</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetName(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name)
    {

        <span class="rem">// before making assignment.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (name.Length &gt; 15)
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error! Name must be less than 16 characters!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
            empName = name;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>This technique requires two uniquely named methods to operate on a single data point. To test your
    new methods, update your Main() method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Encapsulation *****\n"</span>);
    Employee emp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee(<span class="str">"Marvin"</span>, 456, 30000);
    emp.GiveBonus(1000);
    emp.DisplayStats();

    <span class="rem">// Use the get/set methods to interact with the object's name.</span>
    emp.SetName(<span class="str">"Marv"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Employee is named: {0}"</span>, emp.GetName());
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Because of the code in your SetName() method, if you attempted to specify more than 15 characters
    (see below), you would find the hard-coded error message print to the console:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Encapsulation *****\n"</span>);
...
    <span class="rem">// Longer than 15 characters! Error will print to console.</span>
    Employee emp2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();
    emp2.SetName(<span class="str">"Xena the warrior princess"</span>);

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>So far so good. You have encapsulated the private empName field using two methods named
    GetName() and SetName(). If you were to further encapsulate the data in the Employee class, you would
    need to add various additional methods (GetID(), SetID(), GetCurrentPay(), SetCurrentPay() for
    example). Each of the mutator methods could have within it various lines of code to check for additional
    business rules. While this could certainly be done, the C# language has a useful alternative notation to
    encapsulate class data.</p>
    <h2>Encapsulation Using .NET Properties</h2>
    <p>Although you can encapsulate a piece of field data using traditional get and set methods, .NET languages
    prefer to enforce data encapsulation state data using properties. First of all, understand that properties
    are just a simplification for "real" accessor and mutator methods. Therefore, as a class designer, you are
    still able to perform any internal logic necessary before making the value assignment (e.g., uppercase the
    value, scrub the value for illegal characters, check the bounds of a numerical value, and so on).
    Here is the updated Employee class, now enforcing encapsulation of each field using property syntax
    rather than traditional get and set methods:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// Field data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> empName;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay;

    <span class="rem">// Properties!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Name
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empName; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span>
        {
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (value.Length &gt; 15)
                Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error! Name must be less than 16 characters!"</span>);
            <span class="kwrd">else</span>
                empName = value;
        }
    }

    <span class="rem">// We could add additional business rules to the sets of these properties,</span>
    <span class="rem">// however there is no need to do so for this example.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> ID
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empID; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { empID = value; }
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">float</span> Pay
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> currPay; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { currPay = value; }
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>A C# property is composed by defining a get scope (accessor) and set scope (mutator) directly within
    the property itself. Notice that the property specifies the type of data it is encapsulating by what appears
    to be a return value. Also take note that, unlike a method, properties do not make use of parentheses (not
    even empty parentheses) when being defined. Consider the commentary on your current ID property:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The 'int' represents the type of data this property encapsulates.</span>
<span class="rem">// The data type must be identical to the related field (empID).</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> ID <span class="rem">// Note lack of parentheses.</span>
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empID; }
    <span class="kwrd">set</span> { empID = value; }
}</pre>
    <p>Within a 'set' scope of a property, you use a token named value, which is used to represent the
    incoming value used to assign the property by the caller. This token is not a true C# keyword, but is what
    is known as a contextual keyword. When the token value is within the set scope of the property, it always
    represents the value being assigned by the caller, and it will always be the same underlying data type as
    the property itself. Thus, notice how the Name property can still test the range of the string as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Name
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empName; }
    <span class="kwrd">set</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Here, value is really a string.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (value.Length &gt; 15)
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error! Name must be less than 16 characters!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
            empName = value;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Once you have these properties in place, it appears to the caller that it is getting and setting a public
    point of data; however, the correct get and set block is called behind the scenes to preserve encapsulation:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Encapsulation *****\n"</span>);
    Employee emp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee(<span class="str">"Marvin"</span>, 456, 30000);
    emp.GiveBonus(1000);
    emp.DisplayStats();

    <span class="rem">// Set and get the Name property.</span>
    emp.Name = <span class="str">"Marv"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Employee is named: {0}"</span>, emp.Name);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Properties (as opposed to accessors and mutators) also make your types easier to manipulate, in
    that properties are able to respond to the intrinsic operators of C#. To illustrate, assume that the
    Employee class type has an internal private member variable representing the age of the employee. Here
    is the relevant update (notice the use of constructor chaining):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">

        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empAge; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { empAge = value; }
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Employee(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">float</span> pay)
    {
        empName = name;
        empID = id;
        empAge = age;
        currPay = pay;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Updated DisplayStats() method now accounts for age.</span>

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Age: {0}"</span>, empAge);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Pay: {0}"</span>, currPay);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Now assume you have created an Employee object named joe. On his birthday, you wish to
    increment the age by one. Using traditional accessor and mutator methods, you would need to write
    code such as the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Employee joe = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();
joe.SetAge(joe.GetAge() + 1);
</pre>
    <p>However, if you encapsulate empAge using a property named Age, you are able to simply write</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Employee joe = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();
joe.Age++;</pre>
    <h2>Using Properties within a Class Definition</h2>
    <p>Properties, specifically the 'set' portion of a property, are common places to package up the business rules
    of your class. Currently, the Employee class has a Name property which ensures the name is no more than
    15 characters. The remaining properties (ID, Pay and Age) could also be updated with any relevant logic.</p>
    <p>While this is well and good, also consider what a class constructor typically does internally. It will
    take the incoming parameters, check for valid data, and then make assignments to the internal private
    fields. Currently your master constructor does not test the incoming string data for a valid range, so you
    could update this member as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> Employee(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">float</span> pay)
{
    <span class="rem">// Humm, this seems like a problem...</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (name.Length &gt; 15)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error! Name must be less than 16 characters!"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        empName = name;
    
    empID = id;
    empAge = age;
    currPay = pay;
}</pre>
    <p>I am sure you can see the problem with this approach. The Name property and your master
    constructor are performing the same error checking! If you were also making checks on the other data
    points, you would have a good deal of duplicate code. To streamline your code, and isolate all of your
    error checking to a central location, you will do well if you always use properties within your class
    whenever you need to get or set the values. Consider the following updated constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> Employee(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">float</span> pay)
{
    <span class="rem">// Better! Use properties when setting class data.</span>
    <span class="rem">// This reduces the amount of duplicate error checks.</span>
    Name = name;
    Age = age;
    ID = id;
    Pay = pay;
}</pre>
    <p>Beyond updating constructors to use properties when assigning values, it is good practice to use
    properties throughout a class implementation, to ensure your business rules are always enforced. In
    many cases, the only time when you directly make reference to the underlying private piece of data is
    within the property itself. With this in mind, here is your updated Employee cEmployee class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->

    <h2>Internal Representation of Properties</h2>
    <p>Many programmers who use traditional accessor and mutator methods, often name these methods
    using get_ and set_ prefixes (e.g., get_Name() and set_Name()). This naming convention itself is not
    problematic as far as C# is concerned. However, it is important to understand that under the hood, a
    property is represented in CIL code using this same naming convention.</p>
    <p>For example, if you open up the EmployeeApp.exe assembly using ildasm.exe, you see that each
    property is mapped to hidden get_XXX()/set_XXX() methods called internally by the CLR (see Figure 5-6).</p>
	<img src="../Images/Figure05_06.png" alt="Figure 5-6" />
    <p><b>Figure 5-6.</b> A property is represented by get/set methods internally</p>
    <p>Assume the Employee type now has a private member variable named empSSN to represent an
    individual's Social Security number, which is manipulated by a property named SocialSecurityNumber
    (and also assume you have updated your type's custom constructor and DisplayStats() method to
    account for this new piece of field data).</p>

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"SSN: {0}"</span>, SocialSecurityNumber);
    }
    ...
}</pre>
    <p>If you were to also define two methods named get_SocialSecurityNumber() and
    set_SocialSecurityNumber() in the same class, you would be issued compile-time errors:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Remember, a property really maps to a get_/set_ pair!</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> get_SocialSecurityNumber()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> empSSN;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> set_SocialSecurityNumber(<span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn)
    {
        empSSN = ssn;
    }
}</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> The .NET base class libraries always favor type properties over traditional accessor and mutator methods
    when encapsulating field data. Therefore, if you wish to build custom classes that integrate well with the .NET
    platform, avoid defining traditional get and set methods.</p>
    <h2>Controlling Visibility Levels of Property Get/Set Statements</h2>
    <p>Unless you say otherwise, the visibility of get and set logic is solely controlled by the access modifier of
    the property declaration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The get and set logic is both public,</span>
<span class="rem">// given the declaration of the property.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> SocialSecurityNumber
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empSSN; }
    <span class="kwrd">set</span> { empSSN = value; }
}</pre>
    <p>In some cases, it would be useful to specify unique accessibility levels for get and set logic. To do so,
    simply prefix an accessibility keyword to the appropriate get or set keyword (the unqualified scope takes
    the visibility of the property's declaration):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Object users can only get the value, however</span>
<span class="rem">// the Employee class and derived types can set the value.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> SocialSecurityNumber
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empSSN; }
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">set</span> { empSSN = value; }
}</pre>
    <p>In this case, the set logic of SocialSecurityNumber can only be called by the current class and derived
    classes and therefore cannot be called from an object instance. Again, the protected keyword will be
    formally detailed in the next chapter when we examine inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
    <h2>Read-Only and Write-Only Properties</h2>
    <p>When encapsulating data, you may wish to configure a read-only property. To do so, simply omit the set
    block. Likewise, if you wish to have a write-only property, omit the get block. While there is no need to do
    so for the current example, here is how the SocialSecurityNumber property could be retrofitted as readonly:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> SocialSecurityNumber
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empSSN; }
}</pre>
    <p>Given this adjustment, the only manner in which an employee's US Social Security number can be
    set is through a constructor argument. Therefore, it would now be a compiler error to attempt to set an
    employee's SSN value within your master constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> Employee(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">float</span> pay, <span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn)
{
    Name = name;
    Age = age;
    ID = id;
    Pay = pay;
    <span class="rem">// OOPS! This is no longer possible if the property is read</span>
    <span class="rem">// only.</span>
    SocialSecurityNumber = ssn;
}</pre>
    <p>If you did make this property read only, your only choice would be to use the underlying ssn
    member variable within your constructor logic.</p>
    <h2>Static Properties</h2>
    <p>C# also supports static properties. Recall from earlier in this chapter that static members are accessed at
    the class level, not from an instance (object) of that class. For example, assume that the Employee type
    defines a static point of data to represent the name of the organization employing these workers. You
    may encapsulate a static property as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Static properties must operate on static data!</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    ...
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> companyName;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Company
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> companyName; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { companyName = value; }
    }
    ...
}</pre>
    <p>Static properties are manipulated in the same manner as static methods, as shown here:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Interact with the static property.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Encapsulation *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Set company.</span>
    Employee.Company = <span class="str">"My Company"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"These folks work at {0}."</span>, Employee.Company);

    Employee emp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee(<span class="str">"Marvin"</span>, 24, 456, 30000, <span class="str">"111-11-1111"</span>);
    emp.GiveBonus(1000);
    emp.DisplayStats();

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Finally, recall that classes can support static constructors. Thus, if you wanted to ensure that the
    name of the static companyName field was always assigned to "My Company," you would write the
    following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Static constructors are used to initialize static data.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Static companyName As <span class="kwrd">string</span>
...
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> Employee()
    {
        companyName = <span class="str">"My Company"</span>;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Using this approach, there is no need to explicitly call the Company property to set the initial value:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Automatically set to "My Company" via static constructor.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"These folks work at {0}"</span>, Employee.Company);
}</pre>
    <p>To wrap up the story thus far, recall that C# prefers properties to encapsulate data. These syntactic
    entities are used for the same purpose as traditional accessor (get)/mutator (set) methods. The benefit of
    properties is that the users of your objects are able to manipulate the internal data point using a single
    named item.</p>
