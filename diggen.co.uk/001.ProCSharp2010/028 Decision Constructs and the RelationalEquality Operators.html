    <h1>Decision Constructs and the Relational/Equality Operators</h1>
    <p>Now that you can iterate over a block of statements, the next related concept is how to control the flow
    of program execution. C# defines two simple constructs to alter the flow of your program, based on
    various contingencies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The if/else statement</li>
        <li>The switch statement</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The if/else Statement</h2>
    <p>First up is our good friend the if/else statement. Unlike in C and C++, however, the if/else statement
    in C# operates only on Boolean expressions, not ad hoc values such as &#45;1 or 0. Given this, if/else
    statements typically involve the use of the C# operators shown in Table 3&#45;7 in order to obtain a literal
    Boolean value.</p>
    <p><b>Table 3-7.</b> C# Relational and Equality Operators</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>C# Equality/Relational Operator</th>
            <th>Example Usage</th>
            <th>Meaning in Life</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>==</td>
            <td>if(age == 30)</td>
            <td>Returns true only if each expression is the same.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>!=</td>
            <td>if("Foo" != myStr)</td>
            <td>Returns true only if each expression is different.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                &lt;<br />
                &gt;<br />
                &lt;=<br />
                &gt;=<br />
            </td>
            <td>
                if(bonus &lt; 2000)<br />
                if(bonus &gt; 2000)<br />
                if(bonus &lt;= 2000)<br />
                if(bonus &gt;= 2000)<br />
            </td>
            <td>Returns true if expression A (bonus) is less than,
            greater than, less than or equal to, or greater than
            or equal to expression B (2000).</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Again, C and C++ programmers need to be aware that the old tricks of testing a condition for a value
    not equal to zero will not work in C#. Let�s say you want to see whether the string you are working with
    is longer than zero characters. You may be tempted to write</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExecuteIfElse()
{
    <span class="rem">// This is illegal, given that Length returns an int, not a bool.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> stringData = <span class="str">"My textual data"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(stringData.Length)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"string is greater than 0 characters"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>If you wish to make use of the String.Length property to determine truth or falsity, you need to
    modify your conditional expression to resolve to a Boolean.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Legal, as this resolves to either true or false.</span>
<span class="kwrd">if</span>(stringData.Length &gt; 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"string is greater than 0 characters"</span>);
}</pre>
    <p>An if statement may be composed of complex expressions as well and can contain else statements
    to perform more complex testing. The syntax is identical to C(++) and Java. To build complex
    expressions, C# offers an expected set of logical operators, as shown in Table 3-8.</p>
    <p><b>Table 3-8.</b> C# Logical Operators</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>Logical Operator</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Meaning in Life</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&amp;&amp;</td>
            <td>if(age == 30 &amp;&amp; name == "Fred") </td>
            <td>AND operator. Returns true if all
        expressions are true.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>||</td>
            <td>if(age == 30 || name == "Fred")</td>
            <td>OR operator. Returns true if at least one expression is true.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>!</td>
            <td>if(!myBool)</td>
            <td>NOT operator. Returns true if false, or false if true.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><b>Note</b> The &amp;&amp; and || operators both "short circuit" when necessary. This means once a complex expression has
    been determined to be false, the remaining expressions will not be checked.</p>
    <h2>The switch Statement</h2>
    <p>The other simple selection construct offered by C# is the switch statement. As in other C-based
    languages, the switch statement allows you to handle program flow based on a predefined set of choices.
    For example, the following Main() logic prints a specific string message based on one of two possible
    selections (the default case handles an invalid selection).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Switch on a numerical value.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExecuteSwitch()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"1 [C#], 2 [VB]"</span>);
    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Please pick your language preference: "</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">string</span> langChoice = Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> n = <span class="kwrd">int</span>.Parse(langChoice);
    
    <span class="kwrd">switch</span> (n)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> 1:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Good choice, C# is a fine language."</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> 2:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"VB: OOP, multithreading, and more!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">default</span>:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Well...good luck with that!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
    }
}</pre>
    <p><b>Note </b>C# demands that each case (including default) that contains executable statements have a terminating
    break or goto to avoid fall-through.</p>
    <p>One nice feature of the C# switch statement is that you can evaluate string data in addition to
    numeric data. Here is an updated switch statement that does this very thing (notice we have no need to
    parse the user data into a numeric value with this approach).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExecuteSwitchOnString()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"C# or VB"</span>);
    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Please pick your language preference: "</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">string</span> langChoice = Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">switch</span> (langChoice)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> <span class="str">"C#"</span>:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Good choice, C# is a fine language."</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> <span class="str">"VB"</span>:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"VB: OOP, multithreading and more!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">default</span>:
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Well...good luck with that!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
    }
}</pre>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The IterationsAndDecisions project is located under the Chapter 3 subdirectory.</p>
    <p>That wraps up your look at the looping and decision keywords of C#, and the common operators
    that are used to build complex statements. I�ve tried to keep this part of the chapter short and to the
    point, as I am assuming you have experience using similar keywords (if, for, switch, etc.) in your
    current programming language. If you require more information, look up the topic of interest within the
    .NET Framework 4.0 SDK Documentation.</p>
