    <h1>Understanding Constructors</h1>
    <p>Given that objects have state (represented by the values of an object's member variables), a programmer
    will typically want to assign relevant values to the object's field data before use. Currently, the Car 
    class demands that the petName and currSpeed fields be assigned on a field-by-field basis. For the 
    current example, this is not too problematic, given that we have only two public data points. However, 
    it is not uncommon for a class to have dozens of fields to contend with. Clearly, it would be undesirable 
    to author 20 initialization statements to set 20 points of data!</p>
    <p>Thankfully, C# supports the use of constructors, which allow the state of an object to be established #
    at the time of creation. A constructor is a special method of a class that is called indirectly when 
    creating an object using the new keyword. However, unlike a "normal" method, constructors never have 
    a return value (not even void) and are always named identically to the class they are constructing.</p>
    <h2>The Role of the Default Constructor</h2>
    <p>Every C# class is provided with a freebee default constructor that you may redefine if need be. By
    definition, a default constructor never takes arguments. After allocating the new object into memory, the
    default constructor ensures that all field data of the class is set to an appropriate default value (see
    Chapter 3 for information regarding the default values of C# data types).</p>
    <p>If you are not satisfied with these default assignments, you may redefine the default constructor to
    suit your needs. To illustrate, update your C# Car class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="rem">// The 'state' of the Car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> petName;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> currSpeed;

    <span class="rem">// A custom default constructor.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car()
    {
        petName = <span class="str">"Chuck"</span>;
        currSpeed = 10;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>In this case, we are forcing all Car objects to begin life named Chuck at a rate of 10 mph. With this,
    you are able to create a Car object set to these default values as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Invoking the default constructor.</span>
    Car chuck = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();

    <span class="rem">// Prints "Chuck is going 10 MPH."</span>
    chuck.PrintState();
...
}</pre>
    <h2>Defining Custom Constructors</h2>
    <p>Typically, classes define additional constructors beyond the default. In doing so, you provide the object
    user with a simple and consistent way to initialize the state of an object directly at the time of creation.
    Ponder the following update to the Car class, which now supports a total of three constructors:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="rem">// The 'state' of the Car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> petName;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> currSpeed;

    <span class="rem">// A custom default constructor.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car()
    {
        petName = <span class="str">"Chuck"</span>;
        currSpeed = 10;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Here, currSpeed will receive the</span>
    <span class="rem">// default value of an int (zero).</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car(<span class="kwrd">string</span> pn)
    {
        petName = pn;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Let caller set the full state of the Car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car(<span class="kwrd">string</span> pn, <span class="kwrd">int</span> cs)
    {
        petName = pn;
        currSpeed = cs;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>Keep in mind that what makes one constructor different from another (in the eyes of the C#
    compiler) is the number of and type of constructor arguments. Recall from Chapter 4, when you define a
    method of the same name that differs by the number or type of arguments, you have overloaded the
    method. Thus, the Car class has overloaded the constructor to provide a number of ways to create an
    object at the time of declaration. In any case, you are now able to create Car objects using any of the
    public constructors. For example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make a Car called Chuck going 10 MPH.</span>
    Car chuck = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    chuck.PrintState();

    <span class="rem">// Make a Car called Mary going 0 MPH.</span>
    Car mary = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Mary"</span>);
    mary.PrintState();

    <span class="rem">// Make a Car called Daisy going 75 MPH.</span>
    Car daisy = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Daisy"</span>, 75);
    daisy.PrintState();
...
}</pre>
    <h2>The Default Constructor Revisited</h2>
    <p>As you have just learned, all classes are provided with a free default constructor. Thus, if you 
    insert a new class into your current project named Motorcycle, defined like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PopAWheely()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Yeeeeeee Haaaaaeewww!"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
   <p>you are able to create an instance of the Motorcycle type via the default constructor out of the box:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);
    Motorcycle mc = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Motorcycle();
    mc.PopAWheely();
...
}</pre>
   <p>However, as soon as you define a custom constructor, the default constructor is silently removed from 
   the class and is no longer available! Think of it this way: if you do not define a custom constructor, 
   the C# compiler grants you a default in order to allow the object user to allocate an instance of your 
   type with field data set to the correct default values. However, when you define a unique constructor, 
   the compiler assumes you have taken matters into your own hands.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if you wish to allow the object user to create an instance of your type with the default 
   constructor, as well as your custom constructor, you must explicitly redefine the default. To this end, 
   understand that in a vast majority of cases, the implementation of the default constructor of a class 
   is intentionally empty, as all you require is the ability to create an object with default values. 
   Consider the following update to the Motorcycle class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> driverIntensity;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PopAWheely()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt;= driverIntensity; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Yeeeeeee Haaaaaeewww!"</span>);
        }
    }

    <span class="rem">// Put back the default constructor, which will</span>
    <span class="rem">// set all data members to default vaules.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle() {}
    
    <span class="rem">// Our custom constructor.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Motorcycle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> intensity)
    { driverIntensity = intensity; }
}</pre>
