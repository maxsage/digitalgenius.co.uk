<h1>Understanding Database Transactions</h1>
<p>Let’s wrap up this examination of the connected layer of ADO.NET by taking a look at the concept of a
database transaction. Simply put, a transaction is a set of database operations that must either all work
or all fail as a collective unit. As you might imagine, transactions are quite important to ensure that table
data is safe, valid, and consistent.</p>
<p>Transactions are important when a database operation involves interacting with multiple tables or
multiple stored procedures (or a combination of database atoms). The classic transaction example
involves the process of transferring monetary funds between two bank accounts. For example, if you
were to transfer $500.00 from your savings account into your checking account, the following steps
should occur in a transactional manner:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The bank should remove $500.00 from your savings account.</li>
  <li>The bank should add $500.00 to your checking account.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be an extremely bad thing if the money were removed from the savings account, but not
transferred to the checking account (due to some error on the bank’s part) because then you would be
out $500.00! However, if these steps are wrapped up into a database transaction, the DBMS ensures that
all related steps occur as a single unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire operation is rolled
back to the original state. On the other hand, if all steps succeed, the transaction is committed.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You might be familiar with the acronym ACID from looking at transactional literature. This represents the
four key properties of a prim-and-proper transaction: Atomic (all or nothing); Consistent (data remains stable
throughout the transaction); Isolated (transactions do not step on each other’s feet); and Durable (transactions are
saved and logged).</p>
<p>It turns out that the .NET platform supports transactions in a variety of ways. This chapter will look
at the transaction object of your ADO.NET data provider (SqlTransaction, in the case of
System.Data.SqlClient). The .NET base class libraries also provide transactional support within
numerous APIs, including the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>System.EnterpriseServices: This namespace (located in the
System.EnterpriseServices.dll assembly) provides types that allow you to
integrate with the COM+ runtime layer, including its support for distributed
transactions.</li>
 <li>System.Transactions: This namespace (located in the System.Transactions.dll
assembly) contains classes that allow you to write your own transactional
applications and resource managers for a variety of services (e.g., MSMQ,
ADO.NET, and COM+).</li>
 <li>Windows Communication Foundation: The WCF API provides services to facilitate
transactions with various distributed binding classes.</li>
 <li>Windows Workflow Foundations: The WF API provides transactional support for
workflow activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the baked-in transactional support found within the .NET base class libraries, it is also
possible to use the SQL language of your database management system. For example, you could author
a stored procedure that uses the BEGIN TRANSACTION, ROLLBACK, and COMMIT statements.</p>
<h2>Key Members of an ADO.NET Transaction Object</h2>
<p>While transactional-aware types exist throughout the base class libraries, you will focus on transaction
objects found within an ADO.NET data provider, all of which derive from DBTransaction and implement
the IDbTransaction interface. Recall from the beginning of this chapter that -IDbTransaction defines a
handful of members:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDbTransaction : IDisposable
{
    IDbConnection Connection { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    IsolationLevel IsolationLevel { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }

    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Commit();
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Rollback();
}</pre>
<p>Notice the Connection property, which returns a reference to the connection object that initiated the
current transaction (as you’ll see, you obtain a transaction object from a given connection object). You
call the Commit() method when each of your database operations have succeeded. Doing this causes
each of the pending changes to be persisted in the data store. Conversely, you can call the Rollback()
method in the event of a runtime exception, which informs the DMBS to disregard any pending changes,
leaving the original data intact.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The IsolationLevel property of a transaction object allows you to specify how aggressively a
transaction should be guarded against the activities of other parallel transactions. By default, transactions are
isolated completely until committed. Consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details regarding
the values of the IsolationLevel enumeration.</p>
<p>Beyond the members defined by the IDbTransaction interface, the SqlTransaction type defines an
additional member named Save(), which allows you to define save points. This concept allows you to
roll back a failed transaction up until a named point, rather than rolling back the entire transaction.
Essentially, when you call Save() using a SqlTransaction object, you can specify a friendly string
moniker. When you call Rollback(), you can specify this same moniker as an argument to perform an
effective partial rollback. Calling Rollback() with no arguments causes all of the pending changes to be
rolled back.</p>
<h2>Adding a CreditRisks Table to the AutoLot Database</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at how you use ADO.NET transactions. Begin by using the Server Explorer of Visual Studio
2010 to add a new table named CreditRisks to the AutoLot database, which has the same exact columns
as the Customers table you created earlier in this chapter: CustID, which is the primary key; FirstName;
and LastName. As its name suggests, CreditRisks is where you banish the undesirable customers who fail
a credit check. Assuming you have added this new table to your database diagram, you should now see
the AutoLot implementation shown in Figure 21-14.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_14.png" alt="Figure 21-14" />
    <p><b>Figure 21-14</b> The interconnected Orders, Inventory, and Customers tables</p>
<p>Like the earlier savings-to-checking money transfer example, this example, where you move a risky
customer from the Customers table into the CreditRisks table, should occur under the watchful eye of a
transactional scope (after all, you will want to remember the ID and names of those who are not
creditworthy). Specifically, you need to ensure that either you successfully delete the current credit risks
from the Customers table and add them to the CreditRisks table, or you need to ensure that neither of
these database operations occurs.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> In a production environment, you would not need to build a whole new database table to capture high risk
customers; instead, you could add a Boolean column named IsCreditRisk to the existing Customers table.
However, this new table lets you play with a simple transaction.</p>
<h2>Adding a Transaction Method to InventoryDAL</h2>
<p>Now let’s look at how you work with ADO.NET transactions programmatically. Begin by opening the
AutoLotDAL Code Library project you created earlier and add a new public method named
ProcessCreditRisk() to the InventoryDAL class to deal with perceived a credit risks (note that this
example avoids using a parameterized query to keep the implementation simple; however, you’d want
use such a query for a production-level method):</p>

    {

        {

    }

    <span class="rem">// Create command objects that represent each step of the operation.</span>
    SqlCommand cmdRemove = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(

        <span class="rem">// Enlist the commands into this transaction.</span>
        cmdInsert.Transaction = tx;
        cmdRemove.Transaction = tx;

        <span class="rem">// Execute the commands.</span>
        cmdInsert.ExecuteNonQuery();
        cmdRemove.ExecuteNonQuery();

        <span class="rem">// Simulate error.</span>

        }

        <span class="rem">// Commit it!</span>

        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        <span class="rem">// Any error will roll back transaction.</span>
        tx.Rollback();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Here, you use an incoming bool parameter to represent whether you will throw an arbitrary
exception when you attempt to process the offending customer. This allows you to simulate an
unforeseen circumstance that will cause the database transaction to fail. Obviously, you do this here
only for illustrative purposes; a true database transaction method would not want to allow the caller to
force the logic to fail on a whim!</p>
<p>Note that you use two SqlCommand objects to represent each step in the transaction you will kick off.
Once you obtain the customer’s first and last name based on the incoming custID parameter, you can
obtain a valid SqlTransaction object from the connection object using BeginTransaction(). Next, and
most importantly, you must enlist each command object by assigning the Transaction property to the
transaction object you have just obtained. If you fail to do so, the Insert/Delete logic will not be under a
transactional context.</p>
<p>After you call ExecuteNonQuery() on each command, you throw an exception if (and only if) the
value of the bool parameter is true. In this case, all pending database operations are rolled back. If you
do not throw an exception, both steps will be committed to the database tables once you call Commit().
Now compile your modified AutoLotDAL project to ensure you do not have any typos.</p>
<h2>Testing Your Database Transaction</h2>
<p>You could update your previous AutoLotCUIClient application with a new option to invoke the
ProcessCreditRisk() method; instead, however, you will create a new Console Application named
AdoNetTransaction to accomplish this. Set a reference to your AutoLotDAL.dll assembly and import the
AutoLotConnectedLayer namespace.</p>
<p>Next, open your Customers table for data entry by right-clicking the table icon from the Server
Explorer and selecting Show Table Data. Now add a new customer who will be the victim of a low credit
score:</p>
<ul>
 <li>CustID: 333</li>
 <li>FirstName: Homer</li>
 <li>LastName: Simpson</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, update your Main() method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Simple Transaction Example *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// A simple way to allow the tx to succeed or not.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> throwEx = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> userAnswer = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Empty;

    Console.Write(<span class="str">"Do you want to throw an exception (Y or N): "</span>);
    userAnswer = Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (userAnswer.ToLower() == <span class="str">"n"</span>)
    {
        throwEx = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;
    }

    InventoryDAL dal = <span class="kwrd">new</span> InventoryDAL();
    dal.OpenConnection(<span class="str">@"Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=SSPI;"</span> +
        <span class="str">"Initial Catalog=AutoLot"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Process customer 333.</span>
    dal.ProcessCreditRisk(throwEx, 333);

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Check CreditRisk table for results"</span>);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>If you were to run your program and elect to throw an exception, you would find that Homer is not
removed from the Customers table because the entire transaction has been rolled back. However, if you
did not throw an exception, you would find that Customer ID 333 is no longer in the Customers table and
has been placed in the CreditRisks table instead.</p>
