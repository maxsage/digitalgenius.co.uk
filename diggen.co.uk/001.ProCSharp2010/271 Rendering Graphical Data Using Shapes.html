<h1>Rendering Graphical Data Using Shapes</h1>
<p>Members of the System.Windows.Shapes namespace provide the most straightforward, most interactive,
yet most memory-intensive way to render a two-dimensional image. This namespace (defined in the
PresentationFramework.dll assembly) is quite small and consists of only six sealed classes that extend
the abstract Shape base class: Ellipse, Rectangle, Line, Polygon, Polyline, and Path.</p>    
<p>Create a new WPF Application named RenderingWithShapes. Now, if you locate the abstract Shape
class in the Visual Studio 2010 object browser (see Figure 29-1) and expand each of the parent nodes,
you can see that each descendent of Shape receives a great deal of functionality up the inheritance chain.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure29_01.png" alt="Figure 29-1" />
<p><b>Figure 29-1</b> The Shape base class receives a good deal of functionality from its parent classes</p>
<p>Now, given your work in the previous two chapters, some of these parent classes may ring a bell.
Recall, for example, that UIElement defines numerous methods to receive mouse input and deal with
drag-and-drop events, while FrameworkElement defines members to deal with sizing, tooltips, mouse
cursors, and whatnot. Given this inheritance chain, be aware that when you render graphical data using
Shape derived classes, the objects are just about as functional (as far as user interactivity is concerned) as
a WPF control!</p>
<p>For example, determining if the user has clicked on your rendered image is no more complicated
than handling the MouseDown event. By way of a simple example, if you authored the following XAML of a
Rectangle object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Rectangle</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="myRect"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span>
    <span class="attr">Fill</span><span class="kwrd">="Green"</span> <span class="attr">MouseDown</span><span class="kwrd">="myRect_MouseDown"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>you could implement a C# event handler for the MouseDown event that changes the rectangle’s
background color when clicked:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> myRect_MouseDown(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Change color of Rectangle when clicked.</span>
    myRect.Fill = Brushes.Pink;
}</pre>
<p>Unlike with other graphical toolkits you may have used, you do not need to author a ton of
infrastructure code that manually maps mouse coordinates to the geometry, manually calculates hittesting,
renders to an off-screen buffer, and so forth. The members of System.Windows.Shapes simply
respond to the events you register with, just like a typical WPF control (Button, etc).</p>
<p>The downside of all this out-of-the-box functionality is that the shapes do take up a fair amount of
memory. Again, if you’re building a scientific application that plots thousands of points on the screen,
using shapes would be a poor choice (essentially, it would be about as memory-intensive as rendering
thousands of Button objects!). However, when you need to generate an interactive 2D vector image,
shapes are a wonderful choice.</p>
<p>Beyond the functionality inherited from the UIElement and FrameworkElement parent classes, Shape
defines a number of members for each of the children; some of the more useful ones are shown in Table 29-1.</p>

these properties will configure the brush used to draw a border or line.

<p><b>Note</b> If you forget to set the Fill and Stroke properties, WPF will give you “invisible” brushes and therefore
the shape will not be visible on the screen!</p>
<h2>Adding Rectangles, Ellipses, and Lines to a Canvas</h2>
<p>Later in this chapter, you will learn to use Expression Blend and Expression Design to generate XAML
descriptions of graphical data. For now, we will build a WPF application that can render shapes using
XAML and C#, and while doing so, learn a bit about the process of hit-testing. First of all, update the
initial XAML of the &lt;Window&gt; to define a &lt;DockPanel&gt;, containing a (now empty) &lt;ToolBar&gt; and a
&lt;Canvas&gt;. Note that we have given each contained item a fitting name via the Name property.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">DockPanel</span> <span class="attr">LastChildFill</span><span class="kwrd">="True"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">DockPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Now, populate the&lt;ToolBar&gt; with a set of &lt;RadioButton&gt; objects, each of which contains a specific
Shape derived class as content. Notice that each &lt;RadioButton&gt; is assigned to the same GroupName (to
ensure mutual exclusivity) and is also given a fitting name:</p>

            <span class="attr">X1</span><span class="kwrd">="10"</span> <span class="attr">Y1</span><span class="kwrd">="10"</span> <span class="attr">Y2</span><span class="kwrd">="25"</span> <span class="attr">X2</span><span class="kwrd">="25"</span>

<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">ToolBar</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>As you can see, declaring Rectangle, Ellipse, and Line objects in XAML is quite straightforward and
requires little comment. Recall that the Fill property is used to specify a brush to paint the interior of a
shape. When you require a solid-colored brush, you can simply specify a hard-coded string of known
values and the underlying type converter (see Chapter 28) will generate the correct object. One
interesting feature of the Rectangle type is that it defines RadiusX and RadiusY properties to allow you to
render curved corners if you require.</p>
<p>Line represents its starting and end points using the X1, X2, Y1, and Y2 properties (given that height
and width make little sense when describing a line). Here we are setting up a few additional properties that
control how to render the starting and ending points of the Line, as well as how to configure the stroke
settings. Figure 29-2 shows the rendered toolbar, as seen through the Visual Studio 2010 WPF designer:</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure29_02.png" alt="Figure 29-2" />
<p><b>Figure 29-2</b> Using Shapes as content for a set of RadioButtons</p>
<p>Now, using the Properties window of Visual Studio 2010, handle the MouseLeftButtonDown event for
the Canvas, and the Click event for each RadioButton. In your C# file, your goal is to render the selected
shape (a circle, square, or line) when the user clicks within the Canvas. First, define the following nested
enum (and corresponding member variable) within your Window derived class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainWindow : Window
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> SelectedShape
    { Circle, Rectangle, Line }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> SelectedShape currentShape;
...
}</pre>
<p>Within each Click event handler, set the currentShape member variable to the correct
SelectedShape value. For example, here is the implementation code for the Click event of the
circleOption RadioButton. Implement the remaining two Click handlers in a similar manner:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> circleOption_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    currentShape = SelectedShape.Circle;
}</pre>
<p>With the MouseLeftButtonDown event handler of the Canvas, you will render out the correct shape (of
a predefined size), using the X,Y position of the mouse cursor as a starting point. Here is the complete
implementation, with analysis to follow:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> canvasDrawingArea_MouseLeftButtonDown(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    Shape shapeToRender = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    
    <span class="rem">// configure the correct shape to draw.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">switch</span> (currentShape)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> SelectedShape.Circle:
            shapeToRender = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Ellipse() { Fill = Brushes.Green, Height = 35, Width = 35 };
            <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> SelectedShape.Rectangle:
            shapeToRender = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle()
            { Fill = Brushes.Red, Height = 35, Width = 35, RadiusX = 10, RadiusY = 10 };
            <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">case</span> SelectedShape.Line:
            shapeToRender = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Line()
            {
                Stroke = Brushes.Blue,
                StrokeThickness = 10,
                X1 = 0, X2 = 50, Y1 = 0, Y2 = 50,
                StrokeStartLineCap= PenLineCap.Triangle,
                StrokeEndLineCap = PenLineCap.Round
            };
            <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">default</span>:
            <span class="kwrd">return</span>;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Set top / left position to draw in the canvas.</span>
    Canvas.SetLeft(shapeToRender, e.GetPosition(canvasDrawingArea).X);
    Canvas.SetTop(shapeToRender, e.GetPosition(canvasDrawingArea).Y);

    <span class="rem">// Draw shape!</span>
    canvasDrawingArea.Children.Add(shapeToRender);
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> You may notice that the Ellipse, Rectangle, and Line objects being created in this method have the
same property settings as the corresponding XAML definitions! As you might hope, we can streamline this code—
but that requires an understanding of the WPF object resources, which we will examine in Chapter 30.</p>
<p>As you can see, we are testing the currentShape member variable to create the correct Shape derived
object. After this point, we set the top-left value within the Canvas using the incoming
MouseButtonEventArgs. Last but not least, we add the new Shape derived type to the collection of
UIElement objects maintained by the Canvas. If you run your program now, you should be able to click
anywhere in the canvas and see the selected shape rendered at the location of the left mouse-click.</p>
<h2>Removing Rectangles, Ellipses, and Lines from a Canvas</h2>
<p>With the Canvas maintaining a collection of objects, you may wonder how you can dynamically remove
an item, perhaps in response to the user right-clicking on a shape. You can certainly do this, using a class
in the System.Windows.Media namespace called the VisualTreeHelper. In Chapter 31, you will come to
know the role of “visual trees“ and “logical trees“ in some detail. Until then, handle the
MouseRightButtonDown event on your Canvas object, and implement the corresponding event handler like
so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> canvasDrawingArea_MouseRightButtonDown(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// First, get the X,Y location of where the user clicked.</span>
    Point pt = e.GetPosition((Canvas)sender);

    <span class="rem">// Use the HitTest() method of VisualTreeHelper to see if the user clicked</span>
    <span class="rem">// on an item in the canvas.</span>
    HitTestResult result = VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(canvasDrawingArea, pt);

    <span class="rem">// If the result is not null, they DID click on a shape!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (result != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get the underlying shape clicked on, and remove it from</span>
        <span class="rem">// the canvas.</span>
        canvasDrawingArea.Children.Remove(result.VisualHit <span class="kwrd">as</span> Shape);
    }
}</pre>
<p>This method begins by obtaining the exact X,Y location the user clicked in the Canvas, and performs
a hit-test operation via the static VisualTreeHelper.HitTest() method. The return value, a
HitTestResult object, will be set to null if the user does not click on a UIElement within the Canvas. If
HitTestResult is not null, we can obtain the underlying UIElement that was clicked via the VisualHit
property, which we are casting into a Shape derived object (remember, a Canvas can hold any UIElement,
not just shapes!) Again, you’ll get more details on exactly what a “visual tree” is in the next chapter.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> By default, VisualTreeHelper.HitTest() returns the top-most UIElement clicked on, and does not provide
information on other objects below that item (e.g., objects overlapping by Z-order).</p>
<p>With this modification, you should be able to add a shape to the canvas with a left mouse-click, and
delete an item from the canvas with a right mouse-click! Figure 29-3 shows the functionality of the
current example:</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure29_03.png" alt="Figure 29-3" />
<p><b>Figure 29-3</b> Fun with shapes</p>
<p>So far so good. At this point, you have used Shape derived objects to render content on RadioButtons
using XAML and populate a Canvas using C#. We will add a bit more functionality to this example when
we examine the role of brushes and graphical transformations. On a related note, a different example in
this chapter will illustrate drag-and-drop techniques on UIElement objects. Until then, we will examine
the remaining members of System.Windows.Shapes.</p>
<h2>Working with Polylines and Polygons</h2>
<p>The current example used only three of the Shape derived classes. The remaining child classes (Polyline,
Polygon, and Path) are extremely tedious to render correctly without the use of a tool like Expression
Blend, simply because they require a large number of plot points to represent their output. You’ll use
Blend in just a moment, but until then, here is an overview of the remaining Shapes types.</p>
<p>The Polyline type lets you define a collection of (x, y) coordinates (via the Points property) to draw
a series of line segments that do not require connecting ends. The Polygon type is similar; however, it is
programmed so that it will always close the starting and ending points and fill the interior with the
specified brush. Assume you have authored the following &lt;StackPanel&gt; in the kaxaml editor, or better
yet, in the custom XAML editor you created in Chapter 27:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->

<p><b>Figure 29-4</b> Polygons and polylines</p>
<h2>Working with Paths</h2>
<p>Using the Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Polyline, and Line types alone to draw a detailed 2Dvector image
would be extremely complex, as these primitives do not allow you to easily capture graphical data such
as curves, unions of overlapping data, and so forth. The final Shape derived class, Path, provides the
ability to define complex 2D graphical data represented as a collection of independent geometries. Once
you have defined a collection of such geometries, you can assign them to the Data property of the Path
class, where this information will be used to render your complex 2D image.</p>
<p>The Data property takes a System.Windows.Media.Geometry derived class, which contains the key
members described in Table 29-2.</p>
<p><b>Table 29-2.</b> Select Members of the System.Windows.Media.Geometry Type</p>

   <td>

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The classes that extend Geometry (see Table 29-3) look very much like their Shape-derived
counterparts. For example, EllipseGeometry has similar members to Ellipse. The big distinction is that
Geometry derived classes do not know how to render themselves directly, as they are not UIElements.
Rather, Geometry derived classes represent little more than a collection of plot-point data, which say in
effect “If a Path uses my data, this is how I would render myself.”</p>
<p><b>Note</b>Path is not the only class in WPF that can use a collection of geometries. For example,
DoubleAnimationUsingPath, DrawingGroup, GeometryDrawing and even UIElement can all use
geometries for rendering, using the PathGeometry, ClipGeometry, Geometry, and Clip properties,
respectively.</p>

setting the Data property of Path to a GeometryGroup object that contains other Geometry-derived objects
such as EllipseGeometry, RectangleGeometry, and LineGeometry. Figure 29-5 shows the output.</p>

<p><b>Figure 29-5</b> A Path containing various Geometries objects</p>
<p>The image in Figure 29-5 could have been rendered using the Line, Ellipse, and Rectangle classes
shown earlier. However, this would have put various UIElement objects in memory. When you use
geometries to model the plot points of what to draw, and then place the geometry collection into a
container that can render the data (Path, in this case), you reduce the memory overhead.</p>
<p>Now recall that Path has the same inheritance chain as any other member of
System.Windows.Shapes, and therefore has the ability to send the same event notifications as other
UIElements. Thus, if you were to define this same &lt;Path&gt; element in a Visual Studio 2010 project, you
could determine if the user clicked anywhere in the sweeping line simply by handling a mouse event
(remember, kaxaml does not allow you to handle events for the markup you have authored).</p>
<h2>The Path "Modeling Mini Language"</h2>
<p>Of all the classes listed in Table 29-2, PathGeometry is the most complex to configure in terms of XAML or
code. This has to do with the fact that each segment of the PathGeometry is composed of objects that
contain various segments and figures (for example, ArcSegment, BezierSegment, LineSegment,
PolyBezierSegment, PolyLineSegment, PolyQuadraticBezierSegment, etc). Here is an example of a Path
object whose Data property has been set to a &lt;PathGeometry&gt; composed of various figures and segments.</p>

    <p>Now, to be perfectly honest, very few programmers will ever need to manually build complex 2D
images by directly describing Geometry or PathSegment derived classes. In reality, complex paths will be
composed on your behalf when you are working with Expression Blend or Expression Design</p>
<p>Even with the assistance of these tools, the amount of XAML required to define a complex Path
object would be ghastly, as the data consists of full descriptions of various Geometry or PathSegment
derived classes. In order to produce more concise and compact markup, the Path class has been
designed to understand a specialized “mini-language.”</p>
<p>For example, rather than setting the Data property of Path to a collection of Geometry and
PathSegment derived types, you can set the Data property to a single string literal containing a number of
known symbols and various values that define the shape to be rendered. In fact, when you use the
Expression tools to build a Path object, the mini-language is used automatically. Here is a simple
example, and the resulting output (see Figure 29-6).</p>

<p><b>Figure 29-6</b> The path mini-language allows you to compactly describe a Geometry/PathSegment object
model</p>
<p>The M command (short for move) takes an X,Y position that represents the starting point of the
drawing. The C command takes a series of plot points to render a curve (a cubic Bézier curve to be exact)
while H draws a horizontal line.</p>
<p>Now, to be perfectly honest, the chances that you will ever need to manually build or parse a string
literal containing path mini-language instructions are slim to none. However, at the very least, you will
no longer be surprised when you view XAML generated by Expression Blend. If you are interested in
examining the details of this particular grammar, look up “Path Markup Syntax” in the .NET Framework
4.0 SDK documentation.</p>
