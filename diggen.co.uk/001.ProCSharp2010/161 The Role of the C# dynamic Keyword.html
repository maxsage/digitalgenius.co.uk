<h1>The Role of the C# dynamic Keyword</h1>
<p>Back in Chapter 3, you learned about the var keyword, which allows you to define local variable in such a
way that the underlying date type is determined by the initial assignment (recall that this is termed
implicit typing). Once this initial assignment has been made, you have a strongly typed variable, and any
attempt to assign an incompatible value will result in a compiler error.</p>
<p>To begin your investigation into the C# dynamic keyword, create a new Console Application named
DynamicKeyword. Now, author the following method in your Program class, and verify that the final code
statement will indeed trigger a compile time error if uncommented:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ImplicitlyTypedVariable()
{
    <span class="rem">// a is of type List&lt;int&gt;.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> a = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;();
    a.Add(90);

    <span class="rem">// This would be a compile time error!</span>
    <span class="rem">// a = "Hello";</span>
}</pre>
<p>Using implicit typing simply for the sake of doing so is considered bad style (if you know you need a
List&lt;int&gt;, just declare a List&lt;int&gt;). However, as you have seen in Chapter 13, implicit typing is very
useful with LINQ, as many LINQ queries return back enumerations of anonymous class (via projections)
which you cannot directly declare in your C# code. However even in such cases, the implicitly typed
variable is, in fact, strongly typed.</p>
<p>On a related note, as you also learned back in Chapter 6, System.Object is the top-most parent class
in the .NET framework, and can represent anything at all. Again, if you declare a variable of type object,
you have a strongly typed piece of data, however what it points to in memory can differ based on your
assignment of the reference. In order to gain access to the members the object reference is pointing to in
memory, you need to perform an explicit cast.</p>
<p>Assume you have a simple class named Person that defines two automatic properties (FirstName and
LastName) both encapsulating a string. Now, observer the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UseObjectVarible()
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume we have a class named Person.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> o = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person() { FirstName = <span class="str">"Mike"</span>, LastName = <span class="str">"Larson"</span> };

    <span class="rem">// Must cast object as Person to gain access</span>
    <span class="rem">// to the Person properties.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Person's first name is {0}"</span>, ((Person)o).FirstName);
}</pre>
<p>With the release of .NET 4.0, the C# language now supports a new keyword named dynamic. From a
high level, you can consider the dynamic keyword a specialized form of System.Object, in that any value
can be assigned to a dynamic data type. At first glance, this can appear horribly confusing, as it appears
you now have three ways to define data whose underlying type is not directly indicated in our code base.
For example, this method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintThreeStrings()
{
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> s1 = <span class="str">"Greetings"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> s2 = <span class="str">"From"</span>;
    dynamic s3 = <span class="str">"Minneapolis"</span>;

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 is of type: {0}"</span>, s1.GetType());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s2 is of type: {0}"</span>, s2.GetType());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s3 is of type: {0}"</span>, s3.GetType());
}</pre>
<p>would print out the following if invoked from Main():</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
s1 is of type: System.String
s2 is of type: System.String
s3 is of type: System.String
</pre>
<p>What makes a dynamic variable much (much) different from a variable declared implicitly or via a
System.Object reference is that it is not strongly typed. Said another way, dynamic data is not statically
typed. As far as the C# compiler is concerned, a data point declared with the dynamic keyword can be
assigned any initial value at all, and can be reassigned to any new (and possibly unrelated) value during
its lifetime. Consider the following method, and the resulting output:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ChangeDynamicDataType()
{
    <span class="rem">// Declare a single dynamic data point</span>
    <span class="rem">// named 't'.</span>
    dynamic t = <span class="str">"Hello!"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"t is of type: {0}"</span>, t.GetType());

    t = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"t is of type: {0}"</span>, t.GetType());

    t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"t is of type: {0}"</span>, t.GetType());
}</pre>
<pre class="csharpcode">
t is of type: System.String
t is of type: System.Boolean
t is of type: System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Int32]
</pre>
<p>Now, at this point in your investigation, do be aware that the previous code would compile and
execute identically if you were to declare the t variable as a System.Object. However, as you will soon
see, the dynamic keyword offers many additional features.</p>
<h2>Calling Members on Dynamically Declared Data</h2>
<p>Now, given that a dynamic data type can take on the identity of any type on the fly (just like a variable of
type System.Object), the next question on your mind might be about calling members on the dynamic
variable (properties, methods, indexers, register with events, etc). Well, syntactically speaking, it will
again look no different. Just apply the dot operator to the dynamic data variable, specify a public
member, and supply any arguments (if required).</p>
<p>However (and this is a very big “however”), the validity of the members you specify will not be
checked by the compiler! Remember, unlike a variable defined as a System.Object, dynamic data is not
statically typed. It is not until runtime that you will know if you invoked the dynamic data supports a
specified member, if you passed in the correct parameters, spelled the member correctly, and so on.
Thus, as strange as it might seem, the following method compiles perfectly:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> InvokeMembersOnDynamicData()
{
    dynamic textData1 = <span class="str">"Hello"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(textData1.ToUpper());

    <span class="rem">// You would expect compiler errors here!</span>
    <span class="rem">// But they compile just fine.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(textData1.toupper());
    Console.WriteLine(textData1.Foo(10, <span class="str">"ee"</span>, DateTime.Now));
}</pre>
<p>Notice the second call to WriteLine() attempts to call a method named toupper() on the dynamic
data point. As you can see, textData1 is of type string, and therefore you know it does not have a
method of this name in all lower case letters. Furthermore, string certainly does not have a method
named Foo() which takes an int, string and DataTime object!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the C# compiler is satisfied. However, if you invoke this method from within Main(),
you will get runtime errors similar to the following output:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
Unhandled Exception: Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException:
'string' does not contain a definition for 'toupper'
</pre>
<p>Another very big distinction between calling members on dynamic data and strongly typed data is
that when you apply the dot operator to a piece of dynamic data, you will not see the expected Visual
Studio 2010 IntelliSense. Instead, you will find the following general message (see Figure 18-1).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure18_01.png" alt="Figure 18-1" />
<p><b>Figure 18-1.</b> Dynamic data will not activate IntelliSense</p>
<p>It should make sense that IntelliSense is not possible with dynamic data. However remember that
this means you need to be extremely careful when you are typing C# code on such data points! Any
misspelling or incorrect capitalization of a member will throw a runtime error, specifically an instance of
the RuntimeBinderException class.</p>
<h2>The Role of the Microsoft.CSharp.dll Assembly</h2>
<p>When you create a new Visual Studio 2010 C# project, you will automatically have a reference set to a
new .NET 4.0 assembly named Microsoft.CSharp.dll (you can see this for yourself by looking in the
References folder of the Solution Explorer). This library is very small, and only defines a single
namespace (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder) with two classes (see Figure 18-2).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure18_02.png" alt="Figure 18-2" />
<p><b>Figure 18-2</b> The Microsoft.CSharp.dll Assembly</p>
<p>As you can tell by their names, both of these classes are strongly typed exceptions. The most
common class, RuntimeBinderException, represents an error which will be thrown if you attempt to
invoke a member on a dynamic data type which does not actually exist (as in the case of the toupper()
and Foo() methods). This same error will be raised if you specify the wrong parameter data to a member
which does exist.</p>
<p>Because dynamic data is so volatile, whenever you are invoking members on a variable declared
with the C# dynamic keyword you could wrap the calls within a proper try/catch block, and handle the
error in a graceful manner.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> InvokeMembersOnDynamicData()
{
    dynamic textData1 = <span class="str">"Hello"</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        Console.WriteLine(textData1.ToUpper());
        Console.WriteLine(textData1.toupper());
        Console.WriteLine(textData1.Foo(10, <span class="str">"ee"</span>, DateTime.Now));
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Microsoft.CSharp.RuntimeBinder.RuntimeBinderException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you call this method again, you will find the call to ToUpper() (note the capital T and U) works
correctly, however you then find the error data displayed to the console:</p>
<pre>
HELLO
'string' does not contain a definition for'toupper'</pre>
<p>Of course, the process of wrapping all dynamic method invocations in a try/catch block is rather
tedious. As long as you watch your spelling, and parameter passing, this is not required. However,
catching exceptions is handy when you might not know in advance if a member will be present on the
target type.</p>
<h2>The Scope of the dynamic keyword</h2>
<p>Recall that implicitly typed data is only possible for local variables in a member scope. The var keyword
can never be used as a return value, a parameter or a member of a class/structure. This is not the case
with the dynamic keyword however. Consider the following class definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> VeryDynamicClass
{
    <span class="rem">// A dynamic field.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> dynamic myDynamicField;

    <span class="rem">// A dynamic property.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> dynamic DynamicProperty { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="rem">// A dynamic return type and a dynamic paramater type.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> dynamic DynamicMethod(dynamic dynamicParam)
    {
        <span class="rem">// A dynamic local variable.</span>
        dynamic dynamicLocalVar = <span class="str">"Local variable"</span>;
    
        <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 10;
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (dynamicParam <span class="kwrd">is</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span>)
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> dynamicLocalVar;
        }
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> myInt;
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>You could now invoke the public members as expected, however as you are operating on dynamic
methods and properties, you cannot be completely sure what the data type will be! To be sure, the
VeryDynamicClass definition may not be very useful in a real world application, but it does illustrate the
scope of where you can apply this C# keyword.</p>
<h2>Limitations of the dynamic Keyword</h2>
<p>While a great many things can be defined using the dynamic keyword, there are some limitations
regarding its usage. While they are not show stoppers, do know that a dynamic data item cannot make
use of lambda expressions or C# anonymous methods when calling a method. For example, the
following code will always result in errors, even if the target method does indeed take a delegate
parameter which takes a string value and returns void.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
dynamic a = GetDynamicObject();

<span class="rem">// Error! Methods on dynamic data can’t use lambdas!</span>
a.Method(arg =&gt; Console.WriteLine(arg));</pre>
<p>To circumvent this restriction, you will need to work with the underlying delegate directly, using the
techniques described in Chapter 11 (anonymous methods and lambda expressions, etc). Another
limitation is that a dynamic point of data cannot understand any extension methods (see Chapter 12).
Unfortunately, this would also include any of the extension methods which come from the LINQ APIs.
Therefore, a variable declared with the dynamic keyword has very limited use within LINQ to Objects and
other LINQ technologies:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
dynamic a = GetDynamicObject();

<span class="rem">// Error! Dynamic data can’t find the Select() extension method!</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> data = <span class="kwrd">from</span> d <span class="kwrd">in</span> a select d;</pre>
<h2>Practical Uses of the dynamic Keyword</h2>
<p>Given the fact that dynamic data is not strongly typed, not checked at compile time, has no ability to
trigger IntelliSense and cannot be the target of a LINQ query, you are absolutely correct to assume that
using the dynamic keyword just for the sake of doing so is very poor programming practice.</p>
<p>However, in a few circumstances, the dynamic keyword can radically reduce the amount of code
you need to author by hand. Specifically, if you are building a .NET application which makes heavy use
of late binding (via reflection), the dynamic keyword can save you typing time. As well, if you are building
a .NET application that needs to communicate with legacy COM libraries (such as Microsoft Office
products), you can greatly simplify your codebase via the dynamic keyword.</p>
<p>Like any “shortcut,” you need to weigh the pros and cons. The use of the dynamic keyword is a
tradeoff between brevity of code, and type safety. While C# is a strongly typed language at its core, you
can opt in (or opt out) dynamic behaviors on a call by call basis. Always remember that you never need
to use the dynamic keyword. You could always get to the same end result by authoring alternative code by
hand (and typically much more of it).</p>
