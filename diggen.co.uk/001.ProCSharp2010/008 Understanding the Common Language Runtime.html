    <h1>Understanding the Common Language Runtime</h1>
    <p>In addition to the CTS and CLS specifications, the final TLA (three-letter abbreviation) to contend with at
    the moment is the CLR. Programmatically speaking, the term runtime can be understood as a collection
    of services that are required to execute a given compiled unit of code. For example, when developers
    make use of the MFC to create a new application, they are aware that their program requires the MFC
    runtime library (i.e., mfc42.dll). Other popular languages also have a corresponding runtime: VB6
    programmers are tied to a runtime module or two (e.g., msvbvm60.dll), and Java developers are tied to
    the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), for example.</p>
    <p>The .NET platform offers yet another runtime system. The key difference between the .NET runtime
    and the various other runtimes I just mentioned is the fact that the .NET runtime provides a single welldefined
    runtime layer that is shared by all languages and platforms that are .NET-aware.</p>
    <p>The crux of the CLR is physically represented by a library named mscoree.dll (aka the Common
    Object Runtime Execution Engine). When an assembly is referenced for use, mscoree.dll is loaded
    automatically, which in turn loads the required assembly into memory. The runtime engine is
    responsible for a number of tasks. First and foremost, it is the entity in charge of resolving the location of
    an assembly and finding the requested type within the binary by reading the contained metadata. The
    CLR then lays out the type in memory, compiles the associated CIL into platform-specific instructions,
    performs any necessary security checks, and then executes the code in question.</p>
    <p>In addition to loading your custom assemblies and creating your custom types, the CLR will also
    interact with the types contained within the .NET base class libraries when required. Although the entire
    base class library has been broken into a number of discrete assemblies, the key assembly is
    mscorlib.dll, which contains a large number of core types that encapsulate a wide variety of common
    programming tasks as well as the core data types used by all .NET languages. When you build .NET
    solutions, you automatically have access to this particular assembly.</p>
    <p>Figure 1-4 illustrates the workflow that takes place between your source code (which is making use
    of base class library types), a given .NET compiler, and the .NET execution engine.</p>
