<h1>The Feature Set of the ASP.NET API</h1>
    <p>At this point, your whirlwind review of classic web application development is complete, and you are
ready to dive into ASP.NET itself. Before you create your first web application, let me set the stage
regarding the major features of .NET’s web development API, as seen from the major versions of the
framework.</p>
<h2>Major Features of ASP.NET 1.0-1.1</h2>
<p>The first release of ASP.NET (version 1.x) contained a number of features that allow developers to build
web applications in a strongly typed and object oriented matter. Here are some key features which are
supported in all versions of the .NET platform:</p>
<ul>
 <li>ASP.NET provides a model termed code-behind, which allows you to separate
presentation logic (HTML) from business logic (C# code).</li>
 <li>ASP.NET pages are coded using .NET programming languages, rather than server
side scripting languages. The code files are compiled into valid .NET *.dll
assemblies (which translates into much faster execution).</li>
 <li>Web controls allow programmers to build the GUI of a web application in a
manner similar to building a Windows Forms/WPF application.</li>
 <li>By default, ASP.NET web controls automatically maintain their state during
postbacks using a hidden form field named __VIEWSTATE.</li>
 <li>ASP.NET web applications can make use of any of the assemblies within the .NET
base class libraries (of course, it makes little sense to make use of desktop GUI
APIs such as Windows Forms within the context of a web app).</li>
 <li>ASP.NET web applications can be easily configured using standard IIS settings or
using a web application configuration file (Web.config).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first point I want to elaborate on here is the fact that the UI of an ASP.NET web page is built
using any number of web controls. Unlike a typical HTML control, web controls are executed on the web
server and will emit back to the HTTP response their correct HTML tags. This alone is a huge benefit of
ASP.NET in that the amount of HTML you must manually author by hand diminishes greatly. By way of a
quick example, assume you have defined the following ASP.NET web control in an ASP.NET web page:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:Button</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="btnMyButton"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span> <span class="attr">Text</span><span class="kwrd">="Button"</span> <span class="attr">BorderColor</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span>
    <span class="attr">BorderStyle</span><span class="kwrd">="Solid"</span> <span class="attr">BorderWidth</span><span class="kwrd">="5px"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>You’ll learn the details of declaring ASP.NET web controls soon enough, but for right now, notice
that many attributes of the &lt;asp:Button&gt; control look very similar to the properties you have
encountered in the Windows Forms and WPF examples (BorderColor, Text, BorderStyle, etc.). The same
is true for all ASP.NET web controls because when Microsoft built the web control toolkit, these widgets
were purposely designed to look and feel like their desktop counterparts.</p>
<p>Now, if a browser makes a call to the *.aspx file containing this control, the control responds by
emitting into the output stream the following HTML declaration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="attr">type</span><span class="kwrd">="submit"</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="btnMyButton"</span> <span class="attr">value</span><span class="kwrd">="Button"</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="btnMyButton"</span>
    <span class="attr">style</span><span class="kwrd">="border-color:Blue;border-width:5px;border-style:Solid;"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Notice how the web control emits back standard HTML (or XHTML, based on your settings) that can
be rendered in any browser. Given this, understand that using ASP.NET web controls in no way ties you
to the Microsoft family of operating systems or to Microsoft Internet Explorer. Any operating system or
browser (including those on handheld devices such as the Apple iPhone or BlackBerry devices) can view
an ASP.NET web page.</p> 
<p>Next, note from the previous list of features that an ASP.NET web application will be compiled into a
.NET assembly. Thus, your web projects are no different than any .NET *.dll built during this book. The
compiled web application will be composed of CIL code, an assembly MANIFEST, and type metadata.
This has a number of huge benefits, most notably performance gains, strong typing, and the ability to be
micromanaged by the CLR (e.g., garbage collection, etc.).</p>
<p>Finally, ASP.NET web applications provide a programming model whereby you can partition your
page’s markup from its related C# code base using code files. You’ll learn about this topic in just a bit, but
know that this feature addresses a common complaint found when building classic (COM-based) ASP
pages, where a typical *.asp file was a confused mismatch of HTML and script code. Using code files, the
markup you type will map to a full-blown object model that is merged with your C# code file via partial
class declarations.</p>
<h2>Major Features of ASP.NET 2.0</h2>
<p>ASP.NET 1.x was a major step in the right direction, and ASP.NET 2.0 provided many additional bells and
whistles that helped ASP.NET move from a way to build dynamic web pages to a way to build feature rich
web sites. Consider this partial list of key features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Introduction of the ASP.NET Development web server (which means developers
no longer need IIS installed on their development computers).</li>
 <li>A large number of new web controls that handle many complex situations
(navigation controls, security controls, new data binding controls, etc.).</li>
 <li>The introduction of master pages, which allow developers to attach a common UI
frame to a set of related pages.</li>
 <li>Support for themes, which offer a declarative manner to change the look and feel
of the entire web application on the web server.</li>
 <li>Support for Web Parts, which allow end users to customize the look and feel of a
web page and store their settings for later use (a la portals).</li>
 <li>Introduction of a web-based configuration and management utility that maintains
the various Web.config files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the ASP.NET Development web server, one of the biggest additions brought forth with
ASP.NET 2.0 was the introduction of master pages. As you are aware, most web sites have a look and feel
which is common to all pages on the site. Consider a commercial web site such as www.amazon.com.
Every page has the same elements, such as a common header, common footer, common navigation
menus and so on.</p>
<p>Using a master page, you can model this common functionality and define placeholders that other
*.aspx files can plug into. This makes it very easy to quickly reshape the overall look and feel of your site
(reposition the navigation bar, change the header logo, and so on) by simply changing the master page,
leaving the other *.aspx files unmodified.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Master pages are so useful that as of Visual Studio 2010, all new ASP.NET web projects will include a
master page by default.</p>
<p>ASP.NET 2.0 also added many new web controls into the mix, including controls that automatically
incorporate common security features (log in controls, password recovery controls, etc), controls that
allow you to layer a navigational structure on top of a set of related *.aspx files, and even more controls
for performing complex data binding operations, where the necessary SQL queries could be generated
using a set of ASP.NET web controls.</p>
<h2>Major Features of ASP.NET 3.5 (and .NET 3.5 SP1)</h2>
<p>.NET 3.5 added the ability for ASP.NET web applications to make use of the LINQ programming model
(also introduced in .NET 3.5) and the following web-centric features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>New controls to support Silverlight development (recall that this is a WPF-based
API for designing rich media content for a website).</li>
 <li>Support for data binding against ADO.NET entity classes (see Chapter 23).</li>
 <li>Support for ASP.NET Dynamic Data. This is a Ruby on Rails-inspired web
framework that can be used to build data driven web applications. It exposes
tables in a database by encoding it in the URI of the ASP.NET web service, and the
data in the table is automatically rendered to HTML.</li>
 <li>Integrated support for Ajax-style development, which essentially allows for micropostbacks
to refresh part of a web page as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most welcomed features in ASP.NET 3.5 was a new set of controls that allow for Ajax
development. This web-centric API makes it possible to refresh a small portion of a larger web page in
the most efficient manner possible. While Ajax can be used by any web development API, doing so
within an ASP.NET site is very simple because the Ajax controls do all of the heavy lifting by emitting
back the necessary client side JavaScript code on your behalf.</p>
<p>The ASP.NET Dynamic Data project templates, introduced with .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1, provide a
new model to build sites that are driven heavily by a relational database. Of course, most web sites will
need to communicate with databases to some extent, but the ASP.NET Dynamic Data projects are tightly
connected to the ADO.NET Entity Framework and are squarely focused on the rapid development of
data-driven sites (similar to what one might build when using Ruby).</p>
<h2>Major Features of ASP.NET 4.0</h2>
<p>And this brings me to the web features that ship with the current version of the framework, .NET 4.0.
Beyond allowing you to leverage the overall .NET 4.0 features, here is a hit list of some of the key webcentric
features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The ability to compress “view state” data using the GZIP standard.</li>
 <li>Updated browser definitions to ensure that ASP.NET pages render correctly on
new browsers and devices (Google Chrome, Apple IPhone, BlackBerry devices,
etc.).</li>
 <li>Ability to customize the output of validation controls using a cascading style sheet
(CSS). </li>
 <li>Inclusion of the ASP.NET Chart control, which allows for building ASP.NET pages
that include intuitive charts for complex statistical or financial analysis.</li>
 <li>Official support for the ASP.NET Model View Controller project template, which
decreases the dependency among application layers by using the Model-View-
Controller (MVC) pattern.
 </li></ul>
<p>Note that this list of ASP.NET 1.0-4.0 features is in no way all inclusive, but it does accentuate just
how feature-rich this web API truly is. Truth be told, if I were to cover every possible feature of ASP.NET,
this book would easily double in size (triple, perhaps). Since this is not realistic, the goal for the
remainder of text is to examine the core features of ASP.NET that you will likely use on a day-to-day
basis. Be sure to make use of the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation to check out the features not
covered here.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you require a comprehensive treatment of building web applications using ASP.NET, I suggest picking
up a copy of Pro ASP.NET 4.0 in C# 2010, Third Edition by Matthew MacDonald (Apress, 2010).</p>
