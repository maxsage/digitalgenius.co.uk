<h1>Designing Interface Hierarchies</h1>
<p>Interfaces can be arranged in an interface hierarchy. Like a class hierarchy, when an interface extends an
existing interface, it inherits the abstract members defined by the parent(s). Of course, unlike classbased
inheritance, derived interfaces never inherit true implementation. Rather, a derived interface
simply extends its own definition with additional abstract members.</p>
<p>Interface hierarchies can be useful when you wish to extend the functionality of an existing interface
without breaking existing code bases. To illustrate, create a new Console Application named
InterfaceHierarchy. Now, let’s design a new set of rendering-centric interfaces such that IDrawable is the
root of the family tree:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDrawable
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw();
}</pre>
<p>Given that IDrawable defines a basic drawing behavior, we could now create a derived interface that
extends this interface with the ability to render in modified formats, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IAdvancedDraw : IDrawable
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> DrawInBoundingBox(<span class="kwrd">int</span> top, <span class="kwrd">int</span> left, <span class="kwrd">int</span> bottom, <span class="kwrd">int</span> right);
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> DrawUpsideDown();
}</pre>
<p>Given this design, if a class were to implement IAdvancedDraw, it would now be required to
implement each and every member defined up the chain of inheritance (specifically, the Draw(),
DrawInBoundingBox(), and DrawUpsideDown() methods):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BitmapImage : IAdvancedDraw
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing..."</span>);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DrawInBoundingBox(<span class="kwrd">int</span> top, <span class="kwrd">int</span> left, <span class="kwrd">int</span> bottom, <span class="kwrd">int</span> right)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing in a box..."</span>);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DrawUpsideDown()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing upside down!"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, when we make use of the BitmapImage, we are able to invoke each method at the object level
(as they are all public), as well as extract out a reference to each supported interface explicitly via
casting:</p>
 <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Simple Interface Hierarchy *****"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Call from object level.</span>
    BitmapImage myBitmap = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BitmapImage();
    myBitmap.Draw();
    myBitmap.DrawInBoundingBox(10, 10, 100, 150);
    myBitmap.DrawUpsideDown();

    <span class="rem">// Get IAdvancedDraw explicitly.</span>
    IAdvancedDraw iAdvDraw;
    iAdvDraw = (IAdvancedDraw)myBitmap;
    iAdvDraw.DrawUpsideDown();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Multiple Inheritance with Interface Types</h2>
    <p>Unlike class types, a single interface can extend multiple base interfaces, allowing us to design some very
powerful and flexible abstractions. Create a new Console Application project named
MIInterfaceHierarchy. Here is another collection of interfaces that model various rendering and shape
abstractions. Notice that the IShape interface is extending both IDrawable and IPrintable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Multiple inheritance for interface types is a-okay.</span>
<span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDrawable
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw();
}

<span class="kwrd">interface</span> IPrintable
{
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Print();
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw(); <span class="rem">// &lt;-- Note possible name clash here!</span>
}

<span class="rem">// Multiple interface inheritance. OK!</span>
<span class="kwrd">interface</span> IShape : IDrawable, IPrintable
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetNumberOfSides();
}</pre>
    <p><b>Figure 9-7</b> illustrates the current interface hierarchy.</p>

<p><b>Figure 9-7.</b> Unlike classes, interfaces can extend multiple interface types</p>
 <p>Now, the million dollar question is, if you have a class supporting IShape, how many methods will it
be required to implement? The answer: it depends. If you want to provide a simple implementation of
the Draw() method, you need only provide three members, as shown in the following Rectangle type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Rectangle : IShape
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetNumberOfSides()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> 4; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    { Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing..."</span>); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Print()
    { Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Prining..."</span>); }
}</pre>
<p>If you’d rather have specific implementations for each Draw() method (which in this case would
make the most sense), you can resolve the name clash using explicit interface implementation, as shown
in the following Square type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Square : IShape
{
    <span class="rem">// Using explicit implementation to handle member name clash.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> IPrintable.Draw()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Draw to printer ...</span>
    }

    <span class="kwrd">void</span> IDrawable.Draw()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Draw to screen ...</span>
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Print()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Print ...</span>
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetNumberOfSides()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> 4; }
}</pre>
<p>Hopefully, at this point you feel more comfortable with the process of defining and implementing
custom interfaces using the C# syntax. To be honest, interface-based programming can take awhile to
get comfortable with, so if you are in fact still scratching your head just a bit, this is a perfectly normal
reaction.</p>
<p>Do be aware, however, that interfaces are a fundamental aspect of the .NET Framework. Regardless
of the type of application you are developing (web-based, desktop GUIs, data-access libraries, etc.),
working with interfaces will be part of the process. To summarize the story thus far, remember that
interfaces can be extremely useful when</p>
<ul>
 <li>You have a single hierarchy where only a subset of the derived types supports a
    common behavior.</li>
 <li>You need to model a common behavior that is found across multiple hierarchies
    with no common parent class beyond System.Object.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have drilled into the specifics of building and implementing custom interfaces, the
remainder of the chapter examines a number of predefined interfaces contained within the .NET base
class libraries.</p>
