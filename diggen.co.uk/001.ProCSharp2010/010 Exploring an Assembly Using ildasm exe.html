    <h1>Exploring an Assembly Using ildasm.exe</h1>
    <p>If you are beginning to feel a tad overwhelmed at the thought of gaining mastery over every namespace
    in the .NET platform, just remember that what makes a namespace unique is that it contains types that
    are somehow semantically related. Therefore, if you have no need for a user interface beyond a simple
    Console Application, you can forget all about the System.Windows.Forms, System.Windows, and System.Web
    namespaces (among others). If you are building a painting application, the database namespaces are
    most likely of little concern. Like any new set of prefabricated code, you learn as you go.</p>
    <p>The Intermediate Language Disassembler utility (ildasm.exe), which ships with the .NET
    Framework 4.0 SDK, allows you to load up any .NET assembly and investigate its contents, including the
    associated manifest, CIL code, and type metadata. By default, ildasm.exe should be installed under
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin (if you cannot find ildasm.exe in this location,
    simply search your machine for a file named ildasm.exe).</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> You can easily run ildasm.exe by opening a Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt, and type “ildasm”
    (without the quotes) followed by the Enter key.</p>
    <p>Once you run this tool, proceed to the File | Open menu command and navigate to an assembly you
    wish to explore. By way of illustration, here is the Calc.exe assembly generated based on the Calc.cs file
    shown earlier in this chapter (see Figure 1-7). ildasm.exe presents the structure of an assembly using a
    familiar tree-view format.</p>

    <h2>Viewing CIL Code</h2>
    <p>In addition to showing the namespaces, types, and members contained in a given assembly, ildasm.exe
    also allows you to view the CIL instructions for a given member. For example, if you were to double-click
    the Main() method of the Program class, a separate window would display the underlying CIL (see
    Figure 1-8).</p>

    <h2>Viewing Type Metadata</h2>
    <p>If you wish to view the type metadata for the currently loaded assembly, press Ctrl+M. Figure 1-9 shows
    the metadata for the Calc.Add() method.</p>

    <h2>Viewing Assembly Metadata (aka the Manifest)</h2>
    <p>Finally, if you are interested in viewing the contents of the assembly’s manifest, simply double-click the
    MANIFEST icon (see Figure 1-10).</p>

    <p>To be sure, ildasm.exe has more options than shown here, and I will illustrate additional features of
    the tool where appropriate in the text.</p>
