<h1>Creating New Application Domains</h1>
    <p>Recall that a single process is capable of hosting multiple application domains via the static
AppDomain.CreateDomain() method. While creating new app domains on the fly is a rather infrequent
task for most .NET applications, it is important to understand the basics of doing so. For example, as you
will see later in this text, when you build dynamic assemblies (see Chapter 17) you will need to install
them into a custom app domain. As well, several .NET security APIs require you to understand how to
construct new app domains to isolate assemblies based on supplied security credentials.</p>
<p>To investigate how to create new application domains on the fly (and how to load new assemblies
into these custom homes), create a new Console Application named CustomAppDomains. The
AppDomain.CreateDomain() method has been overloaded a number of times. At minimum, you will
specify the friendly name of the new application domain to be constructed. Update your Program class with
the following code: Here, you are leveraging the ListAllAssembliesInAppDomain() method from the previous
example, however this time you are passing in the AppDomain object to analyze as an incoming argument:</p>

            orderby a.GetName().Name select a;

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Here are the assemblies loaded in {0} *****\n"</span>,
            ad.FriendlyName);
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> a <span class="kwrd">in</span> loadedAssemblies)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Name: {0}"</span>, a.GetName().Name);
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Version: {0}\n"</span>, a.GetName().Version);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you run the current example, you will see that the default application domain
(CustomAppDomains.exe) has loaded mscorlib.dll, System.dll, System.Core.dll and
CustomAppDomains.exe, given the C# code base of the current project. However, the new application
domain only contains mscorlib.dll, which as you recall is the one .NET assembly which is always loaded
by the CLR for each and every application domain:</p>

***** Here are the assemblies loaded in CustomAppDomains.exe *****

-&gt; Name: CustomAppDomains

<p><b>Note</b> If you debug this project (via F5), you will find many additional assemblies are loaded into each
AppDomain which are used by the Visual Studio debugging process. Running this project (via Ctrl + F5) will display
only the assemblies directly by each app domain.</p>
<p>This may seem counterintuitive if you have a background in traditional Windows (as you might
suspect, both application domains have access to the same assembly set). Recall, however, that an
assembly loads into an application domain, not directly into the process itself.</p>
<h2>Loading Assemblies into Custom Application Domains</h2>
<p>The CLR will always load assemblies into the default application domain when required. However, if you
do ever manually create new app domains, you can load assemblies into said app domain using the
AppDomain.Load() method. Also, be aware that the AppDomain.ExecuteAssembly() method can be called
to load an *.exe assembly and execute the Main() method.</p>
<p>Assume that you wish to load CarLibrary.dll into your new secondary app domain. Provided you
have copied this library to the \bin\Debug folder of the current application you could update the
MakeNewAppDomain() method as so (be sure to import the System.IO namespace, to gain access to the
FileNotFoundException class):</p>

    }

    <span class="rem">// List all assemblies.</span>
    ListAllAssembliesInAppDomain(newAD);

<p>This time, the output of the program would appear as so (note the presence of CarLibrary.dll):</p>

<p><b>Note</b> Remember! If you debug this application, you will see many additional libraries loaded into each
application domain.</p>
<h2>Programmatically Unloading AppDomains</h2>
<p>It is important to point out that the CLR does not permit unloading individual .NET assemblies.
However, using the AppDomain.Unload() method, you are able to selectively unload a given application
domain from its hosting process. When you do so, the application domain will unload each assembly in
turn.</p>
<p>Recall that the AppDomain type defines the DomainUnload event, which is fired when a custom
application domain is unloaded from the containing process. Another event of interest is the
ProcessExit event, which is fired when the default application domain is unloaded from the process
(which obviously entails the termination of the process itself).</p>
<p>If you wish to programmatically unload newAD from the hosting process, and be notified when the
associated application domain is torn down, you could update MakeNewAppDomain() with the following
additional logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MakeNewAppDomain()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a new AppDomain in the current process.</span>
    AppDomain newAD = AppDomain.CreateDomain(<span class="str">"SecondAppDomain"</span>);
    newAD.DomainUnload += (o, s) =&gt;
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The second app domain has been unloaded!"</span>);
    };
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Now load CarLibrary.dll into this new domain.</span>
        newAD.Load(<span class="str">"CarLibrary"</span>);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (FileNotFoundException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }

    <span class="rem">// List all assemblies.</span>
    ListAllAssembliesInAppDomain(newAD);

    <span class="rem">// Now tear down this app domain.</span>
    AppDomain.Unload(newAD);
}</pre>
<p>If you wish to be notified when the default application domain is unloaded, modify your Main()
method to handle the ProcessEvent event of the default application domain:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Custom App Domains *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Show all loaded assemblies in default app domain.</span>
    AppDomain defaultAD = AppDomain.CurrentDomain;
    defaultAD.ProcessExit += (o, s) =&gt;
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Default AD unloaded!"</span>);
    };

    ListAllAssembliesInAppDomain(defaultAD);

    MakeNewAppDomain();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>That wraps up our look at the .NET application domain. To conclude this chapter, let’s look at one
further level of partitioning, which is used to group objects into contextual boundaries.</p>
