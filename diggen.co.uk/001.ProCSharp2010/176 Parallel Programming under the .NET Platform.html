<h1>Parallel Programming under the .NET Platform</h1>
   <p>If you go shopping at any electronic “super store,” you will quickly notice that computers which support
two or more CPUs (aka, cores) are commonplace. Not only are they commonplace, they are quite cost
effective; dual core laptops can be purchased for less than $500.00 USD. When a machine supports
multiple CPUs, it has the ability to execute threads in a parallel fashion, which can significantly improve
the runtime performance of applications.</p> 
<p>Traditionally speaking, if you wanted to build a .NET application which can distribute its workload
across multiple cores, you needed to be quite skilled in multithreaded programming techniques (using
many of the topics seen in this chapter). While this was certainly possible, doing so was tedious and
error prone, given the inherit complexities of building multithreaded applications.</p>
<p>With the release of .NET 4.0, you are provided with a brand new parallel programming library. Using
the types of System.Threading.Tasks, you can build fine-grained, scalable parallel code without having
to work directly with threads or the thread pool. Furthermore, when you do so, you can make use of
strongly typed LINQ queries (via parallel LINQ, or PLINQ) to divide up your workload.</p>
<h2>The Task Parallel Library API</h2>
<p>Collectively speaking, the types of System.Threading.Tasks (as well as some related types in
System.Threading) are referred to as the Task Parallel Library, or TPL. The TPL will automatically
distribute your application’s workload across available CPUs dynamically using the CLR thread pool.
The TPL handles the partitioning of the work, thread scheduling, state management, and other low-level
details. The end result is that you can maximize the performance of your .NET applications, while being
shielded from many of complexities of directly working with threads. Figure 19-3 shows the members of
this new .NET 4.0 namespace.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure19_03.png" alt="Figure 19-3" />
<p><b>Figure 19-3</b> Members of the System.Threading.Tasks namespace</p>
<p>Starting with .NET 4.0, use of the TPL is the recommended way to build multithreaded applications.
This is certainly not to suggest that having an understanding of traditional multithreading techniques
using asynchronous delegates or the classes of System.Threading is somehow obsolete. In fact, to
effectively use the TPL, you must understand primitive such as threads, locks, and concurrency.
Furthermore, many situations that require multiple threads (such as asynchronous calls to remote
objects) can be handled without the use of the TPL. Nevertheless, the amount of time you will need to
directly work with the Thread class decreases significantly.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware that just because you can, does not mean you should. In the same way that
creating multiple threads can slow down the execution of your .NET programs, authoring a ton of
unnecessary parallel tasks can hurt performance. Use the functionality of the TPL only when you have a
workload which truly creates a bottleneck in your programs, such as iterating over hundreds of objects,
processing data in multiple files, etc.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The TPL infrastructure is rather intelligent. If it determines that a set of tasks would gain little or no benefit
by running in parallel, it will opt to perform them in sequence.</p>
<h2>The Role of the Parallel Class</h2>
<p>The primary class of the TPL is System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel. This class supports a number of
methods which allow you to iterate over a collection of data (specifically, an object implementing
IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;) in a parallel fashion. If you were to look up the Parallel class in the .NET Framework
4.0 SDK documentation, you’ll see that this class supports two primary static methods, Parallel.For()
and Parallel.ForEach(), each of which defines numerous overloaded versions.</p>
<p>These methods allow you to author a body of code statements which will be processed in a parallel
manner. In concept, these statements are the same sort of logic you would write in a normal looping
construct (via the for or foreach C# keywords). The benefit however, is that the Parallel class will pluck
threads from the thread pool (and manage concurrency) on your behalf.</p>
<p>Both of these methods require you to specify an IEnumerable or IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; compatible
container that holds the data you need to process in a parallel manner. The container could be a simple
array, a non-generic collection (such as ArrayList), a generic collection (such as List&lt;T&gt;), or the results
of a LINQ query.</p>
<p>In addition, you will need to make use of the System.Func&lt;T&gt; and System.Action&lt;T&gt; delegates to
specify the target method which will be called to process the data. You’ve already encountered the
Func&lt;T&gt; delegate in Chapter 13 during your investigation of LINQ to Objects. Recall that Func&lt;T&gt;
represents a method which can have a given return value and a varied number of arguments. The
Action&lt;T&gt; delegate is very similar to Func&lt;T&gt;, in that it allows you to point to a method taking some
number of parameters. However, Action&lt;T&gt; specifies a method which can only return void.</p>
<p>While you could call the Parallel.For() and Parallel.ForEach() methods and pass a strongly typed
Func&lt;T&gt; or Action&lt;T&gt; delegate object, you can simplify your programming by making use of a fitting C#
anonymous method or lambda expression.</p>
<h2>Understanding Data Parallelism</h2>
<p>The first way to use the TPL is to perform data parallelism. Simply put, this term refers to the task of
iterating over an array or collection in a parallel manner using the Parallel.For() or Parallel.ForEach()
methods. Assume you need to perform some labor intensive File IO operations. Specifically, you need to
load a large number of *.jpg files into memory, flip them upside-down, and save the modified image
data to a new location.</p>
<p>The .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation provides a console based example of this very thing,
however we will perform the same overall task using a graphical user interface. To illustrate, create a
Windows Forms application named DataParallelismWithForEach, and rename the Form1.cs to
MainForm.cs. Once you do, import the following namespaces in your primary code file:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Need these namespaces!</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Threading.Tasks;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Threading;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.IO;</pre>
<p>The GUI of the application consists of a multiline TextBox and a single Button (named
btnProcessImages). The purpose of the text area is to allow you to enter data while the work is being
performed in the background, thus illustrating the non-blocking nature of the parallel task. The Click
event of this Button will eventually make use of the TPL, but for now, author the following blocking code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MainForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnProcessImages_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        ProcessFiles();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessFiles()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Load up all *.jpg files, and make a new folder for the modified data.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] files = Directory.GetFiles
            (<span class="str">@"C:\Users\AndrewTroelsen\Pictures\My Family"</span>, <span class="str">"*.jpg"</span>,
            SearchOption.AllDirectories);
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> newDir = <span class="str">@"C:\ModifiedPictures"</span>;
        Directory.CreateDirectory(newDir);

        <span class="rem">// Process the image data in a blocking manner.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> currentFile <span class="kwrd">in</span> files)
        {
            <span class="kwrd">string</span> filename = Path.GetFileName(currentFile);

            <span class="kwrd">using</span> (Bitmap bitmap = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Bitmap(currentFile))
            {
                bitmap.RotateFlip(RotateFlipType.Rotate180FlipNone);
                bitmap.Save(Path.Combine(newDir, filename));
                <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Processing {0} on thread {1}"</span>, filename,
                Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
            }
        }
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = <span class="str">"All done!"</span>;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the ProcessFiles() method will rotate each *.jpg file under my personal Pictures\My
Family subdirectory, which currently contains a total of 37 files (be sure to update the path sent into
Directory.GetFiles() as necessary). Currently, all of the work is happening on the primary thread of the
executable. Therefore, if the button is clicked, the program will appear to hang. Furthermore, the
caption of the window will also report that the same primary thread is processing the file (Figure 19- 4).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure19_04.png" alt="Figure 19-4" />
<p><b>Figure 19-4</b> Currently, all action is taking place on the primary thread</p>
<p>To process the files on as many CPUs as possible, you can rewrite the current foreach loop to make
use of Parallel.ForEach(). Recall that this method has been overloaded numerous times, however in
the simplest form, you must specify the IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; compatible object that contains the items to
process (that would be the files string array) and an Action&lt;T&gt; delegate which points to the method that
will perform the work. Here is the relevant update, using the C# lambda operator, in place of a literal
Action&lt;T&gt; delegate object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Process the image data in a parallel manner!</span>
Parallel.ForEach(files, currentFile =&gt;
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> filename = Path.GetFileName(currentFile);

        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (Bitmap bitmap = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Bitmap(currentFile))
        {
            bitmap.RotateFlip(RotateFlipType.Rotate180FlipNone);
            bitmap.Save(Path.Combine(newDir, filename));
            <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Processing {0} on thread {1}"</span>, filename,
                Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
        }
    }
);</pre>
<p>Now, if you run program, the TPL will indeed distribute the workload to multiple threads from the
thread pool, using as many CPUs as possible. However, you will not see the window’s caption display the
name of each unique thread and you won’t see anything if you type in the text box, until all the images
have been processed! The reason is that the primary UI thread is still blocked, waiting for all of the other
threads to finish up their business.</p>
<h2>The Task Class</h2>
<p>To keep the user interface responsive, you could certainly make use of asynchronous delegates or the
members of the System.Threading namespace directly, but the System.Threading.Tasks namespace
provides a simpler alternative, via the Task class. Task allows you to easily invoke a method on a
secondary thread, and can be used as a simple alternative to working with asynchronous delegates.
Update the Click handler of your Button control as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnProcessImages_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Start a new "task" to process the files.</span>
    Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt;
    {
        ProcessFiles();
    });
}</pre>
<p>The Factory property of Task returns a TaskFactory object. When you call its StartNew() method,
you pass in an Action&lt;T&gt; delegate (here, hidden away with a fitting lambda expression) which points to
the method to invoke in an asynchronous manner. With this small update, you will now find that the
window’s title will show which thread from the thread pool is processing a given file, and better yet, the
text area is able to receive input, as the UI thread is no longer blocked.</p>
<h2>Handling Cancelation Request</h2>
<p>One improvement you can make to the current example is to provide a way for the user to stop the
processing of the image data, via a second (aptly named) Cancel button. Thankfully, the Parallel.For()
and Parallel.ForEach() methods both support cancellation through the use of cancellation tokens.
When you invoke methods on Parallel, you can pass in a ParallelOptions object, which in turn
contains a CancellationTokenSource object.</p>
<p>First of all, define a new private member variable in your Form derived class of type
CancellationTokenSource named cancelToken:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    <span class="rem">// New Form level variable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> CancellationTokenSource cancelToken =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> CancellationTokenSource();
...
}</pre>
<p>Now, assuming you have added a new Button (named btnCancel) on your designer, handle the Click
event, and implement the handler as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnCancelTask_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// This will be used to tell all the worker threads to stop!</span>
    cancelToken.Cancel();
}</pre>
<p>Now, the real modifications need to occur within the ProcessFiles() method. Consider the final
implementation:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessFiles()
{
    <span class="rem">// Use ParallelOptions instance to store the CancellationToken</span>
    ParallelOptions parOpts = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ParallelOptions();
    parOpts.CancellationToken = cancelToken.Token;
    parOpts.MaxDegreeOfParallelism = System.Environment.ProcessorCount;

    <span class="rem">// Load up all *.jpg files, and make a new folder for the modified data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] files = Directory.GetFiles
        (<span class="str">@"C:\Users\AndrewTroelsen\Pictures\My Family"</span>, <span class="str">"*.jpg"</span>,
            SearchOption.AllDirectories);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> newDir = <span class="str">@"C:\ModifiedPictures"</span>;
    Directory.CreateDirectory(newDir);
    
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Process the image data in a parallel manner!</span>
        Parallel.ForEach(files, parOpts, currentFile =&gt;
        {
            parOpts.CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
    
            <span class="kwrd">string</span> filename = Path.GetFileName(currentFile);
            <span class="kwrd">using</span> (Bitmap bitmap = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Bitmap(currentFile))
            {
                bitmap.RotateFlip(RotateFlipType.Rotate180FlipNone);
                bitmap.Save(Path.Combine(newDir, filename));
                <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Processing {0} on thread {1}"</span>, filename,
                    Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
            }
        }
        );
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = <span class="str">"All done!"</span>;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (OperationCanceledException ex)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = ex.Message;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that you begin the method by configuring a ParallelOptions object, setting the
CancellationToken property to use the CancellationTokenSource token. Also note that when you call the
Parallel.ForEach() method, you pass in the ParallelOptions object as the second parameter.</p>
<p>Within the scope of the looping logic, you make a call to ThrowIfCancellationRequested() on the
token, which will ensure if the user clicks the Cancel button, all threads will stop and you will be notified
via a runtime exception. When you catch the OperationCanceledException error, you will set the text of
the main window to the error message.</p>
<h2>Understanding Task Parallelism</h2>
<p>In addition to data parallelism, the TPL can also be used to easily fire off any number of asynchronous
tasks using the Parallel.Invoke() method. This approach is a bit more straightforward than using
delegates or members from System.Threading, however if you require more control over the way tasks
are executed, you could forgo use of Parallel.Invoke() and make use of the Task class directly, as you
did in the previous example.</p>
<p>To illustrate task parallelism, create a new Windows Forms application called MyEBookReader and
import the System.Threading.Tasks and System.Net namespaces.</p>
<p>This application is a modification of a useful example in the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK
documentation, which will fetch a free e-book from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org), and
then perform a set of lengthy tasks in parallel.</p>
<p>The GUI consists of a multi-line TextBox control (named txtBook) and two Button controls
(btnDownload and btnGetStats). Once you have designed the UI, handle the Click event for each Button,
and in the form’s code file, declare a class level string variable named theEBook. Implement the Click
hander for the btnDownload as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnDownload_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    WebClient wc = <span class="kwrd">new</span> WebClient();
    wc.DownloadStringCompleted += (s, eArgs) =&gt;
    {
        theEBook = eArgs.Result;
        txtBook.Text = theEBook;
    };

    <span class="rem">// The Project Gutenberg EBook of A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens</span>
    wc.DownloadStringAsync(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-8.txt"</span>));
}</pre>
<p>The WebClient class is a member of System.Net. This class provides a number of methods for
sending data to and receiving data from a resource identified by a URI. As it turns out, many of these
methods have an asynchronous version, such as DownloadStringAsyn(). This method will spin up a new
thread from the CLR thread pool automatically. When the WebClient is done obtaining the data, it will
fire the DownloadStringCompleted event, which you are handling here using a C# lambda expression. If
you were to call the synchronous version of this method (DownloadString()) the form would appear
unresponsive for quite some time.</p>
<p>The Click event hander for the btnGetStats Button control is implemented to extract out the
individual words contained in theEBook variable, and then pass the string array to a few helper functions
for processing:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetStats_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get the words from the e-book.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] words = theEBook.Split(<span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">char</span>[]
    { <span class="str">' '</span>, <span class="str">'\u000A'</span>, <span class="str">','</span>, <span class="str">'.'</span>, <span class="str">';'</span>, <span class="str">':'</span>, <span class="str">'-'</span>, <span class="str">'?'</span>, <span class="str">'/'</span> },
    StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

    <span class="rem">// Now, find the ten most common words.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] tenMostCommon = FindTenMostCommon(words);

    <span class="rem">// Get the longest word.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> longestWord = FindLongestWord(words);

    <span class="rem">// Now that all tasks are complete, build a string to show all</span>
    <span class="rem">// stats in a message box.</span>
    StringBuilder bookStats = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringBuilder(<span class="str">"Ten Most Common Words are:\n"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> s <span class="kwrd">in</span> tenMostCommon)
    {
        bookStats.AppendLine(s);
    }
    bookStats.AppendFormat(<span class="str">"Longest word is: {0}"</span>, longestWord);
    bookStats.AppendLine();
    MessageBox.Show(bookStats.ToString(), <span class="str">"Book info"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>The FindTenMostCommon() method uses a LINQ query to obtain a list of string objects which occur
most often in the string array, while FindLongestWord() locates, well, the longest word:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] FindTenMostCommon(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] words)
{
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> frequencyOrder = <span class="kwrd">from</span> word <span class="kwrd">in</span> words
        where word.Length &gt; 6
        group word by word into g
        orderby g.Count() descending
        select g.Key;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] commonWords = (frequencyOrder.Take(10)).ToArray();
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> commonWords;
}

<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> FindLongestWord(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] words)
{
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> (<span class="kwrd">from</span> w <span class="kwrd">in</span> words orderby w.Length descending select w).First();
}</pre>
<p>If you were to run this project, the amount of time to perform all tasks could take a goodly amount
of time, based on the CPU count of your machine and overall processor speed. Eventually, you should
see the following output (Figure 19-5).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure19_05.png" alt="Figure 19-5" /> 
<p><b>Figure 19-5</b> Stats about the downloaded EBook</p>
<p>You can help ensure that your application makes use of all available CPUs on the host machine by
invoking the FindTenMostCommon() and FindLongestWord()method in parallel. To do so, modify your
btnGetStats_Click() method as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetStats_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get the words from the e-book.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] words = theEBook.Split(
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">char</span>[] { <span class="str">' '</span>, <span class="str">'\u000A'</span>, <span class="str">','</span>, <span class="str">'.'</span>, <span class="str">';'</span>, <span class="str">':'</span>, <span class="str">'-'</span>, <span class="str">'?'</span>, <span class="str">'/'</span> },
        StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] tenMostCommon = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> longestWord = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Empty;

    Parallel.Invoke(
        () =&gt;
        {
            <span class="rem">// Now, find the ten most common words.</span>
            tenMostCommon = FindTenMostCommon(words);
        },
        () =&gt;
        {
            <span class="rem">// Get the longest word.</span>
            longestWord = FindLongestWord(words);
        });

    <span class="rem">// Now that all tasks are complete, build a string to show all</span>
    <span class="rem">// stats in a message box.</span>
...
}</pre>
<p>The Parallel.Invoke() method expects a parameter array of Action&lt;&gt; delegates, which you have
supplied indirectly using lambda expressions. Again, while the output is identical, the benefit is that the
TPL will now make use of all possible processors on the machine to invoke each method in parallel if
possible.</p>
