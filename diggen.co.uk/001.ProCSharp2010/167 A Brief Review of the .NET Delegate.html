<h1>A Brief Review of the .NET Delegate</h1>
    <p>Recall that the .NET delegate type is essentially a type-safe, object-oriented, function pointer. When you
declare a .NET delegate, the C# compiler responds by building a sealed class that derives from
System.MulticastDelegate (which in turn derives from System.Delegate). These base classes provide
every delegate with the ability to maintain a list of method addresses, all of which may be invoked at a
later time. Consider the BinaryOp delegate first defined in Chapter 11:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A C# delegate type.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> BinaryOp(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y);</pre>
<p>Based on its definition, BinaryOp can point to any method taking two integers (by value) as
arguments and returning an integer. Once compiled, the defining assembly now contains a full-blown
class definition that is dynamically generated when you build your project, based on the delegate
declaration. In the case of BinaryOp, this class looks more or less like the following (shown in pseudocode):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BinaryOp : System.MulticastDelegate
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> BinaryOp(<span class="kwrd">object</span> target, <span class="kwrd">uint</span> functionAddress);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Invoke(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> IAsyncResult BeginInvoke(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y,
        AsyncCallback cb, <span class="kwrd">object</span> state);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> EndInvoke(IAsyncResult result);
}</pre>
<p>Recall that the generated Invoke() method is used to invoke the methods maintained by a delegate
object in a synchronous manner. Therefore, the calling thread (such as the primary thread of the
application) is forced to wait until the delegate invocation completes. Also recall that in C#, the Invoke()
method does not need to be directly called in code, but can be triggered indirectly under the hood when
applying “normal” method invocation syntax.</p>
<p>Consider the following Console Application program (SyncDelegateReview), which invokes the
static Add() method in a synchronous (a.k.a. blocking) manner (be sure to import the System.Threading
namespace, as you will be calling the Thread.Sleep() method).</p>

            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"10 + 10 is {0}."</span>, answer);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
        {
            <span class="rem">// Print out the ID of the executing thread.</span>
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Add() invoked on thread {0}."</span>,
                Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
            <span class="rem">// Pause to simulate a lengthy operation.</span>
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y;
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Within the Add() method, you are invoking the static Thread.Sleep() method to suspend the calling
thread for approximately five seconds to simulate a lengthy task. Given that you are invoking the Add()
method in a synchronous manner, the Main() method will not print out the result of the operation until
the Add() method has completed.</p>
<p>Next, note that the Main() method is obtaining access to the current thread (via
Thread.CurrentThread) and printing out the ID of the thread via the ManagedThreadId property. This
same logic is repeated in the static Add() method. As you might suspect, given that all the work in this
application is performed exclusively by the primary thread, you find the same ID value displayed to the
console:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Synch Delegate Review *****
Main() invoked on thread 1.
Add() invoked on thread 1.
Doing more work in Main()!
10 + 10 is 20.

Press any key to continue . . .
</pre>
<p>When you run this program, you should notice that a five-second delay takes place before you see
the final Console.WriteLine() logic in Main() execute. Although many (if not most) methods may be
called synchronously without ill effect, .NET delegates can be instructed to call their methods
asynchronously if necessary.</p>
