    <h1>C# Iteration Constructs</h1>
    <p>All programming languages provide ways to repeat blocks of code until a terminating condition has been
    met. Regardless of which language you have used in the past, the C# iteration statements should not
    raise too many eyebrows and should require little explanation. C# provides the following four iteration
    constructs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>for loop</li>
        <li>foreach/in loop</li>
        <li>while loop</li>
        <li>do/while loop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's quickly examine each looping construct in turn, using a new Console Application project
    named IterationsAndDecisions.</p>
    <h2>The for Loop</h2>
    <p>When you need to iterate over a block of code a fixed number of times, the for statement provides a
    good deal of flexibility. In essence, you are able to specify how many times a block of code repeats itself,
    as well as the terminating condition. Without belaboring the point, here is a sample of the syntax.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A basic for loop.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ForAndForEachLoop()
{
    <span class="rem">// Note! "i" is only visible within the scope of the for loop.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">for</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Number is: {0} "</span>, i);
    }
    <span class="rem">// "i" is not visible here.</span>
}</pre>
    <p>All of your old C, C++, and Java tricks still hold when building a C# for statement. You can create
    complex terminating conditions, build endless loops, and make use of the goto, continue, and break
    keywords. I'll assume that you will bend this iteration construct as you see fit. Consult the .NET
    Framework 4.0 SDK documentation if you require further details on the C# for keyword.</p>
    <h2>The foreach Loop</h2>
    <p>The C# foreach keyword allows you to iterate over all items within an array (or a collection object; see
    Chapter 10) without the need to test for an upper limit. Here are two examples using foreach&#45;one to
    traverse an array of strings and the other to traverse an array of integers.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Iterate array items using foreach.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ForAndForEachLoop()
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] carTypes = {<span class="str">"Ford"</span>, <span class="str">"BMW"</span>, <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>, <span class="str">"Honda"</span> };
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carTypes)
        Console.WriteLine(c);
    
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] myInts = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> myInts)
        Console.WriteLine(i);
}</pre>    
    <p>In addition to iterating over simple arrays, foreach is also able to iterate over system-supplied or
    user-defined collections. I'll hold off on the details until Chapter 9, as this aspect of the foreach keyword
    entails an understanding of interface-based programming and the role of the IEnumerator and
    IEnumerable interfaces.</p>
    <h2>Use of var Within foreach Constructs</h2>
    <p>It is also possible to make use of implicit typing within a foreach looping construct. As you would expect,
    the compiler will correctly infer the correct "type of type." Consider the following method, which iterates
    over a local array of integers:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> VarInForeachLoop()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] myInts = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
    
    <span class="rem">// Use "var" in a standard foreach loop.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> myInts)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item value: {0}"</span>, item);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Understand that in this example there is no compelling reason to use the var keyword in our
    foreach loop, as we can clearly see that we are indeed iterating over an array of integers. But once again,
    when using the LINQ programming model, using var within a foreach loop will be very useful, and in
    some cases, absolutely mandatory.</p>
    <h2>The while and do/while Looping Constructs</h2>
    <p>The while looping construct is useful should you wish to execute a block of statements until some
    terminating condition has been reached. Within the scope of a while loop, you will need to ensure this
    terminating event is indeed established; otherwise, you will be stuck in an endless loop. In the following
    example, the message "In while loop" will be continuously printed until the user terminates the loop by
    entering yes at the command prompt:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExecuteWhileLoop()
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> userIsDone = <span class="str">""</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Test on a lower-class copy of the string.</span>
    while(userIsDone.ToLower() != <span class="str">"yes"</span>)
    {
        Console.Write(<span class="str">"Are you done? [yes] [no]: "</span>);
        userIsDone = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"In while loop"</span>);
    }
}
</pre>
    <p>Closely related to the while loop is the do/while statement. Like a simple while loop, do/while is
    used when you need to perform some action an undetermined number of times. The difference is that
    do/while loops are guaranteed to execute the corresponding block of code at least once. In contrast, it is
    possible that a simple while loop may never execute if the terminating condition is false from the onset.</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExecuteDoWhileLoop()
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> userIsDone = <span class="str">""</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">do</span>
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"In do/while loop"</span>);
        Console.Write(<span class="str">"Are you done? [yes] [no]: "</span>);
        userIsDone = Console.ReadLine();
    }while(userIsDone.ToLower() != <span class="str">"yes"</span>); <span class="rem">// Note the semicolon!</span>
}</pre>
