<h1>Choosing a Serialization Formatter</h1>
    <p>Once you configure your types to participate in the .NET serialization scheme by applying the necessary
attributes, your next step is to choose which format (binary, SOAP, or XML) you should use when
persisting your object’s state. Each possibility is represented by the following classes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>BinaryFormatter</li>
 <li>SoapFormatter</li>
 <li>XmlSerializer</li>
</ul>
<p>The BinaryFormatter type serializes your object’s state to a stream using a compact binary format.
This type is defined within the System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary namespace that is
part of mscorlib.dll. If you wish to gain access to this type, you can specify the following C# using
directive:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Gain access to the BinaryFormatter in mscorlib.dll.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;</pre>
<p>The SoapFormatter type persists an object’s state as a SOAP message (the standard XML format for
passing messages to/from a web service). This type is defined within the
System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap namespace, which is defined in a separate assembly.
Thus, to format your object graph into a SOAP message, you must first set a reference to
System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.dll using the Visual Studio 2010 Add Reference dialog
box and then specify the following C# using directive:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Must reference System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.dll.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap;</pre>
<p>Finally, if you wish to persist a tree of objects as an XML document, you can use the XmlSerializer
type. To use this type, you need to specify that you are using the System.Xml.Serialization namespace
and set a reference to the assembly System.Xml.dll. As luck would have it, all Visual Studio 2010 project
templates automatically reference System.Xml.dll; therefore, all you need to do is use the following
namespace:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Defined within System.Xml.dll.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Xml.Serialization;</pre>
<h2>The IFormatter and IRemotingFormatter Interfaces</h2>
<p>Regardless of which formatter you choose to use, be aware that all of them derive directly from
System.Object, so they do not share a common set of members from a serialization-centric base class.
However, the BinaryFormatter and SoapFormatter types do support common members through the
implementation of the IFormatter and IRemotingFormatter interfaces (strange as it might seem, the
XmlSerializer implements neither).</p>
<p>System.Runtime.Serialization.IFormatter defines the core Serialize() and Deserialize()
methods, which do the grunt work to move your object graphs into and out of a specific stream. Beyond
these members, IFormatter defines a few properties that the implementing type uses behind the scenes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IFormatter
{
    SerializationBinder Binder { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    StreamingContext Context { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    ISurrogateSelector SurrogateSelector { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> Deserialize(Stream serializationStream);
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Serialize(Stream serializationStream, <span class="kwrd">object</span> graph);
}</pre>
<p>The System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.IRemotingFormatter interface (which is leveraged
internally by the .NET remoting layer) overloads the Serialize() and Deserialize() members into a
manner more appropriate for distributed persistence. Note that IRemotingFormatter derives from the
more general IFormatter interface:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IRemotingFormatter : IFormatter
{
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> Deserialize(Stream serializationStream, HeaderHandler handler);
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Serialize(Stream serializationStream, <span class="kwrd">object</span> graph, Header[] headers);
}</pre>
<p>Although you might not need to interact directly with these interfaces for most of your serialization
endeavors, recall that interface-based polymorphism allows you to hold an instance of BinaryFormatter
or SoapFormatter using an IFormatter reference. Therefore, if you wish to build a method that can
serialize an object graph using either of these classes, you could write the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SerializeObjectGraph(IFormatter itfFormat,
    Stream destStream, <span class="kwrd">object</span> graph)
{
    itfFormat.Serialize(destStream, graph);
}</pre>
<h2>Type Fidelity Among the Formatters</h2>
<p>The most obvious difference among the three formatters is how the object graph is persisted to the
stream (binary, SOAP, or XML). You should also be aware of a few more subtle points of distinction;
specifically, how the formatters contend with type fidelity. When you use the BinaryFormatter type, it
will persist not only the field data of the objects in the object graph, but also each type’s fully qualified
name and the full name of the defining assembly (name, version, public key token, and culture). These
extra points of data make the BinaryFormatter an ideal choice when you wish to transport objects by
value (e.g., as a full copy) across machine boundaries for .NET-centric applications.</p>
<p>The SoapFormatter persists traces of the assembly of origin through the use of an XML namespace.
For example, recall the Person type earlier in this chapter. If this type were persisted as a SOAP message,
you would find that the opening element of Person is qualified by the generated xmlns. Consider this
partial definition, paying special attention to the a1 XML namespace:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">a1:Person</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="ref-1"</span> <span class="attr">xmlns:a1</span>=
    <span class="kwrd">"http://schemas.microsoft.com/clr/nsassem/SimpleSerialize/MyApp%2C%20
    Version%3D1.0.0.0%2C%20Culture%3Dneutral%2C%20PublicKeyToken%3Dnull"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">isAlive</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>true<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">isAlive</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">personAge</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>21<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">personAge</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">fName</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="ref-3"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="html">fName</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">a1:Person</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>However, the XmlSerializer does not attempt to preserve full type fidelity; therefore, it does not
record the type’s fully qualified name or assembly of origin. This might seem like a limitation at first
glance, but XML serialization is used by classic .NET web services, which can be called from clients on
any platform (not just .NET). This means that there is no point serializing full .NET type metadata. Here
is a possible XML representation of the Person type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;?</span><span class="html">xml</span> <span class="attr">version</span><span class="kwrd">="1.0"</span>?<span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Person</span> <span class="attr">xmlns:xsi</span><span class="kwrd">="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"</span>
        <span class="attr">xmlns:xsd</span><span class="kwrd">="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">isAlive</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>true<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">isAlive</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">PersonAge</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>21<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">PersonAge</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">FirstName</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Person</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>If you wish to persist an object’s state in a manner that can be used by any operating system (e.g.,
Windows XP, Mac OS X, and various Linux distributions), application framework (e.g., .NET, Java
Enterprise Edition, and COM), or programming language, you do not want to maintain full type fidelity
because you cannot assume all possible recipients can understand .NET-specific data types. Given this,
SoapFormatter and XmlSerializer are ideal choices when you wish to ensure as broad a reach as possible
for the persisted tree of objects.</p>
