<h1>Building Finalizable Objects</h1>
 <p>In Chapter 6, you learned that the supreme base class of .NET, System.Object, defines a virtual method
named Finalize(). The default implementation of this method does nothing whatsoever:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// System.<span class="kwrd">Object</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> <span class="kwrd">Object</span>
{
    ...
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> virtual void Finalize() {}
}</pre>
<p>When you override Finalize() for your custom classes, you establish a specific location to perform
any necessary cleanup logic for your type. Given that this member is defined as protected, it is not
possible to directly call an object’s Finalize() method from a class instance via the dot operator. Rather,
the garbage collector will call an object’s Finalize() method (if supported) before removing the object
from memory.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> It is illegal to override Finalize() on structure types. This makes perfect sense given that structures are
value types, which are never allocated on the heap to begin with and therefore are not garbage collected!
However, if you create a structure that contains unmanaged resources that need to be cleaned up, you can
implement the IDisposable interface (described shortly).</p>
<p>Of course, a call to Finalize() will (eventually) occur during a “natural” garbage collection or when
you programmatically force a collection via GC.Collect(). In addition, a type’s finalizer method will
automatically be called when the application domain hosting your application is unloaded from
memory. Depending on your background in .NET, you may know that application domains (or simply
AppDomains) are used to host an executable assembly and any necessary external code libraries. If you
are not familiar with this .NET concept, you will be by the time you’ve finished Chapter 16. For now, note
that when your AppDomain is unloaded from memory, the CLR automatically invokes finalizers for
every finalizable object created during its lifetime.</p>
<p>Now, despite what your developer instincts may tell you, the vast majority of your C# classes will not
require any explicit cleanup logic or a custom finalizer. The reason is simple: if your classes are just
making use of other managed objects, everything will eventually be garbage-collected. The only time
you would need to design a class that can clean up after itself is when you are using unmanaged
resources (such as raw OS file handles, raw unmanaged database connections, chunks of unmanaged
memory, or other unmanaged resources). Under the .NET platform, unmanaged resources are obtained
by directly calling into the API of the operating system using Platform Invocation Services (PInvoke) or
as a result of some very elaborate COM interoperability scenarios. Given this, consider the next rule of
garbage collection:</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The only reason to override Finalize() is if your C# class is making use of unmanaged resources via
PInvoke or complex COM interoperability tasks (typically via various members defined by the
System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal type).</p>
<h2>Overriding System.Object.Finalize()</h2>
<p>In the rare case that you do build a C# class that uses unmanaged resources, you will obviously want to
ensure that the underlying memory is released in a predictable manner. Suppose you have created a new
C# Console Application named SimpleFinalize and inserted a class named MyResourceWrapper that uses
an unmanaged resource (whatever that may be) and you want to override Finalize(). The odd thing
about doing so in C# is that you can’t do it using the expected override keyword:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyResourceWrapper
{
    // Compile-time <span class="kwrd">error</span>!
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> override void Finalize(){ }
}</pre>
<p>Rather, when you want to configure your custom C# class types to override the Finalize() method,
you make use of a (C++-like) destructor syntax to achieve the same effect. The reason for this alternative
form of overriding a virtual method is that when the C# compiler processes the finalizer syntax, it
automatically adds a good deal of required infrastructure within the implicitly overridden Finalize()
method (shown in just a moment).</p>
<p>C# finalizers look very similar to constructors in that they are named identically to the class they are
defined within. In addition, finalizers are prefixed with a tilde symbol (~). Unlike a constructor, however,
a finalizer never takes an access modifier (they are implicitly protected), never takes parameters, and
can’t be overloaded (only one finalizer per class).</p>
<p>Here is a custom finalizer for MyResourceWrapper that will issue a system beep when invoked.
Obviously, this example is only for instructional purposes. A real-world finalizer would do nothing more
than free any unmanaged resources and would not interact with other managed objects, even those
referenced by the current object, as you can’t assume they are still alive at the point the garbage collector
invokes your Finalize() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Override System.<span class="kwrd">Object</span>.Finalize() via finalizer syntax.
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyResourceWrapper
{
    ~MyResourceWrapper()
    {
        // Clean up unmanaged resources here.

        // Beep <span class="kwrd">when</span> destroyed (testing purposes only!)
        Console.Beep();
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you were to examine this C# destructor using ildasm.exe, you would see that the compiler inserts
some necessary error-checking code. First, the code statements within the scope of your Finalize()
method are placed within a try block (see Chapter 7). The related finally block ensures that your base
classes’ Finalize() method will always execute, regardless of any exceptions encountered within the try
scope:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method family hidebysig virtual instance void
	Finalize() cil managed
{
	// Code size 13 (0xd)
	.maxstack 1
	.try
	{
		IL_0000: ldc.i4 0x4e20
		IL_0005: ldc.i4 0x3e8
		IL_000a: call
		void [mscorlib]System.Console::Beep(int32, int32)
		IL_000f: nop
		IL_0010: nop
		IL_0011: leave.s IL_001b
	} // end .try
	finally
	{
		IL_0013: ldarg.0
		IL_0014:
			call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::Finalize()
		IL_0019: nop
		IL_001a: endfinally
	} // end handler
	IL_001b: nop
	IL_001c: ret
} // end of method MyResourceWrapper::Finalize
    </pre>
    <p>If you then tested the MyResourceWrapper type, you would find that a system beep occurs when the
application terminates, given that the CLR will automatically invoke finalizers upon AppDomain
shutdown:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Finalizers *****\n"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hit the return key to shut down this app"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"and force the GC to invoke Finalize()"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"for finalizable objects created in this AppDomain."</span>);
    Console.ReadLine();
    MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper();
}</pre>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The SimpleFinalize project is included under the Chapter 8 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>Detailing the Finalization Process</h2>
<p>Not to beat a dead horse, but always remember that the role of the Finalize() method is to ensure that a
.NET object can clean up unmanaged resources when it is garbage-collected. Thus, if you are building a
class that does not make use of unmanaged entities (by far the most common case), finalization is of
little use. In fact, if at all possible, you should design your types to avoid supporting a Finalize() method
for the very simple reason that finalization takes time.</p>
<p>When you allocate an object onto the managed heap, the runtime automatically determines
whether your object supports a custom Finalize() method. If so, the object is marked as finalizable, and
a pointer to this object is stored on an internal queue named the finalization queue. The finalization
queue is a table maintained by the garbage collector that points to each and every object that must be
finalized before it is removed from the heap.</p>
<p>When the garbage collector determines it is time to free an object from memory, it examines each
entry on the finalization queue and copies the object off the heap to yet another managed structure
termed the finalization reachable table (often abbreviated as freachable, and pronounced “effreachable”).
At this point, a separate thread is spawned to invoke the Finalize() method for each object
on the freachable table at the next garbage collection. Given this, it will take at the very least two garbage
collections to truly finalize an object.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that while finalization of an object does ensure an object can clean up
unmanaged resources, it is still nondeterministic in nature, and due to the extra behind-the-curtains
processing, considerably slower.</p>
