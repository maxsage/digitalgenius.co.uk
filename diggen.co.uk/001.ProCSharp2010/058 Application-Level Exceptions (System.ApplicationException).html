<h1>Application-Level Exceptions (System.ApplicationException)</h1>
 <p>Given that all .NET exceptions are class types, you are free to create your own application-specific
exceptions. However, due to the fact that the System.SystemException base class represents exceptions
thrown from the CLR, you may naturally assume that you should derive your custom exceptions
from the System.Exception type. You could do this, but you could instead derive from the
System.ApplicationException class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ApplicationException : Exception
{
    <span class="rem">// Various constructors.</span>
}</pre>
<p>Like SystemException, ApplicationException does not define any additional members beyond a set
of constructors. Functionally, the only purpose of System.ApplicationException is to identify the source
of the error. When you handle an exception deriving from System.ApplicationException, you can
assume the exception was raised by the code base of the executing application, rather than by the .NET
base class libraries or .NET runtime engine.</p>
      <h2>Building Custom Exceptions, Take One</h2>
 <p>While you can always throw instances of System.Exception to signal a runtime error (as shown in the
first example), it is sometimes advantageous to build a strongly typed exception that represents the
unique details of your current problem. For example, assume you wish to build a custom exception
(named CarIsDeadException) to represent the error of speeding up a doomed automobile. The first step
is to derive a new class from System.Exception/System.ApplicationException (by convention, all
exception classes end with the “Exception” suffix; in fact, this is a .NET best practice).</p>
<p>Note <b></b>As a rule, all custom exception classes should be defined as public classes (recall, the default access
modifier of a non-nested type is internal). The reason is that exceptions are often passed outside of assembly
boundaries, and should therefore be accessible to the calling code base. </p>
<p>Create a new Console Application project named CustomException, and copy the previous Car.cs
and Radio.cs files into your new project using the Project ? Add Existing Item menu option (for clarity,
be sure to change the namespace that defines the Car and Radio types from SimpleException to
CustomException). Next, add the following class definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This custom exception describes the details of the car-is-dead condition.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarIsDeadException : ApplicationException
{}</pre>
<p>As with any class, you are free to include any number of custom members that can be called within
the catch block of the calling logic. You are also free to override any virtual members defined by your
parent classes. For example, we could implement the CarIsDeadException by overriding the virtual
Message property.</p>
<p>As well, rather than populating a data dictionary (via the Data property) when throwing our
exception, our constructor allows the sender to pass in a time stamp and reason for the error. Finally, the
time stamp data and cause of the error can be obtained using strongly typed properties:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarIsDeadException : ApplicationException
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> messageDetails = String.Empty;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> DateTime ErrorTimeStamp {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> CauseOfError {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException(){}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message,
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> cause, DateTime time)
    {
        messageDetails = message;
        CauseOfError = cause;
        ErrorTimeStamp = time;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Override the Exception.Message property.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Message
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span>
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Car Error Message: {0}"</span>, messageDetails);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Here, the CarIsDeadException class maintains a private field (messageDetails) that represents data
regarding the current exception, which can be set using a custom constructor. Throwing this exception
from the Accelerate() method is straightforward. Simply allocate, configure, and throw a
CarIsDeadException type rather than a System.Exception (notice that in this case, we no longer need to
fill the data collection manually):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Throw the custom CarIsDeadException.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Accelerate(<span class="kwrd">int</span> delta)
{
...
    CarIsDeadException ex =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> CarIsDeadException (<span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"{0} has overheated!"</span>, PetName),
            <span class="str">"You have a lead foot"</span>, DateTime.Now);

    ex.HelpLink = <span class="str">"http://www.CarsRUs.com"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">throw</span> ex;
...
}</pre>
<p>To catch this incoming exception, your catch scope can now be updated to catch a specific
CarIsDeadException type (however, given that CarIsDeadException “is-a” Application.Exception, it is still
permissible to catch a Application.Exception as well): </p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Custom Exceptions *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 90);

    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Trip exception.</span>
        myCar.Accelerate(50);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (CarIsDeadException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.WriteLine(e.ErrorTimeStamp);
        Console.WriteLine(e.CauseOfError);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>So, now that you understand the basic process of building a custom exception, you may wonder
when you are required to do so. Typically, you only need to create custom exceptions when the error is
tightly bound to the class issuing the error (for example, a custom file-centric class that throws a number
of file-related errors, a Car class that throws a number of car-related errors, a data access object that
throws errors regarding a particular database table, and so forth). In doing so, you provide the caller with
the ability to handle numerous exceptions on a descriptive error-by-error basis.</p>
<h2>Building Custom Exceptions, Take Two</h2>
    <p>The current CarIsDeadException type has overridden the virtual System.Exception.Message property in
order to configure a custom error message, and has supplied two custom properties to account for
additional bits of data. In reality, however, you are not required to override the virtual Message property,
as you could simply pass the incoming message to the parent’s constructor as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarIsDeadException : ApplicationException
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> DateTime ErrorTimeStamp { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> CauseOfError { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException() { }

    <span class="rem">// Feed message to parent constructor.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message, <span class="kwrd">string</span> cause, DateTime time)
        :<span class="kwrd">base</span>(message)
    {
        CauseOfError = cause;
        ErrorTimeStamp = time;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that this time you have not defined a string variable to represent the message, and have not
overridden the Message property. Rather, you are simply passing the parameter to your base class
constructor. With this design, a custom exception class is little more than a uniquely named class
deriving from System.ApplicationException, (with additional properties if appropriate), devoid of any
base class overrides.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised if most (if not all) of your custom exception classes follow this simple pattern.
Many times, the role of a custom exception is not necessarily to provide additional functionality beyond
what is inherited from the base classes, but to supply a strongly named type that clearly identifies the
nature of the error, so the client can provide different handler-logic for different types of exceptions.</p>
<h2>Building Custom Exceptions, Take Three</h2>
    <p>If you wish to build a truly prim-and-proper custom exception class, you would want to make sure your
type adheres to .NET best practices. Specifically, this requires that your custom exception</p>
<ul>
 <li>Derives from ApplicationException</li>
 <li>Is marked with the [System.Serializable] attribute</li>
 <li>Defines a default constructor</li>
 <li>Defines a constructor that sets the inherited Message property</li>
 <li>Defines a constructor to handle "inner exceptions"</li>
 <li>Defines a constructor to handle the serialization of your type</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, based on your current background with .NET, you may have no idea regarding the role of
attributes or object serialization, which is just fine. I’ll address these topics later in the text (see Chapter
15 for information on attributes and Chapter 20 for details on serialization services). However, to
complete our examination of building custom exceptions, here is the final iteration of
CarIsDeadException, which accounts for each of these special constructors:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarIsDeadException : ApplicationException
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException() { }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message) : <span class="kwrd">base</span>( message ) { }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarIsDeadException(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message,
        System.Exception inner)
        : <span class="kwrd">base</span>( message, inner ) { }
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> CarIsDeadException(
        System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo info,
        System.Runtime.Serialization.StreamingContext context)
        : <span class="kwrd">base</span>( info, context ) { }

    <span class="rem">// Any additional custom properties, constructors and data members...</span>
}</pre>
<p>Given that building custom exceptions that adhere to .NET best practices really differ by only their
name, you will be happy to know that Visual Studio 2010 provides a code snippet template named
"Exception" (see Figure 7-1) that will autogenerate a new exception class that adheres to .NET best
practices. (Recall from Chapter 2, a code snippet can be activated by typing its name [exception in this
case] and pressing the Tab key twice.)</p>
