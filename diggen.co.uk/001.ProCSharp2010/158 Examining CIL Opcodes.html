<h1>Examining CIL Opcodes</h1>
<p>The final aspect of CIL code you’ll examine in this chapter has to do with the role of various -operational
codes (opcodes). Recall that an opcode is simply a CIL token used to build the implementation logic for
a given member. The complete set of CIL opcodes (which is fairly large) can be grouped into the
following broad categories:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Opcodes that control program flow</li>
  <li>Opcodes that evaluate expressions</li>
  <li>Opcodes that access values in memory (via parameters, local variables, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide some insight to the world of member implementation via CIL, Table 17-5 defines some of the
more useful opcodes that are directly related to member implementation logic, grouped by related functionality</p>

    These CIL opcodes (in addition to many other related opcodes) are used to
control branching logic within a method, for example:
beq: Break to code label if equal
bgt: Break to code label if greater than
ble: Break to code label if less than or equal to
blt: Break to code label if less than
All of the branch-centric opcodes require that you specify a CIL code label
to jump to if the result of the test is true.

  </tr>
</table>
<p>The next broad category of CIL opcodes (a subset of which is shown in Table 17-6) are used to load
(push) arguments onto the virtual execution stack. Note how these load-specific opcodes take an ld
(load) prefix.</p>

    ldarg (with numerous variations)
   </td>
   <td>
    Loads a method’s argument onto the stack. In addition to the
general ldarg (which works in conjunction with a given index
that identifies the argument), there are numerous other variations.
For example, ldarg opcodes that have a numerical suffix
(ldarg_0) hard-code which argument to load. As well, variations
of the ldarg opcode allow you to hard-code the data type using
the CIL constant notation shown in Table 17-4 (ldarg_I4, for an
int32) as well as the data type and value (ldarg_I4_5, to load an
int32 with the value of 5).

    ldstr
   </td>
   <td>
    Loads a string value onto the stack.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to the set of load-specific opcodes, CIL provides numerous opcodes that explicitly pop
the topmost value off the stack. As shown over the first few examples in this chapter, popping a value off
the stack typically involves storing the value into temporary local storage for further use (such as a
parameter for an upcoming method invocation). Given this, note how many opcodes that pop the
current value off the virtual execution stack take an st (store) prefix. Table 17-7 hits the highlights.</p>

<h2>The .maxstack Directive</h2>
<p>When you write method implementations using raw CIL, you need to be mindful of a special directive
named .maxstack. As its name suggests, .maxstack establishes the maximum number of variables that
may be pushed onto the stack at any given time during the execution of the method. The good news is
that the .maxstack directive has a default value (8), which should be safe for a vast majority of methods
you may be authoring. However, if you wish to be very explicit, you are able to manually calculate the
number of local variables on the stack and define this value explicitly:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig instance void
    Speak() cil managed
{
    // During the scope of this method, exactly
    // 1 value (the string literal) is on the stack.
    .maxstack 1
    ldstr "Hello there..."
    call void [mscorlib]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    ret
}
</pre>
<h2>Declaring Local Variables in CIL</h2>
<p>Let’s first check out how to declare a local variable. Assume you wish to build a method in CIL named
MyLocalVariables() that takes no arguments and returns void. Within the method, you wish to define
three local variables of type System.String, System.Int32, and System.Object. In C#, this member would
appear as follows (recall that locally scoped variables do not receive a default value and should be set to
an initial state before further use):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MyLocalVariables()
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> myStr = <span class="str">"CIL code is fun!"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 33;
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> myObj = <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span>();
}</pre>
<p>If you were to construct MyLocalVariables() directly in CIL, you could author the following:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig static void
    MyLocalVariables() cil managed
{
    .maxstack 8
    // Define three local variables.
    .locals init ([0] string myStr, [1] int32 myInt, [2] object myObj)

    // Load a string onto the virtual execution stack.
    ldstr "CIL code is fun!"
    // Pop off current value and store in local variable [0].
    stloc.0

    // Load a constant of type "i4"
    // (shorthand for int32) set to the value 33.
    ldc.i4 33
    // Pop off current value and store in local variable [1].
    stloc.1

    // Create a new object and place on stack.
    newobj instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()
    // Pop off current value and store in local variable [2].
    stloc.2
    ret
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, the first step taken to allocate local variables in raw CIL is to make use of the .locals
directive, which is paired with the init attribute. Within the scope of the related parentheses, your goal
is to associate a given numerical index to each variable (seen here as [0], [1], and [2]). As you can see,
each index is identified by its data type and an optional variable name. Once the local variables have
been defined, you load a value onto the stack (using the various load-centric opcodes) and store the
value within the local variable (using the various storage-centric opcodes).</p>
<h2>Mapping Parameters to Local Variables in CIL</h2>
<p>You have already seen how to declare local variables in raw CIL using the .locals init directive; however,
you have yet to see exactly how to map incoming parameters to local methods. Consider the following
static C# method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> a, <span class="kwrd">int</span> b)
{
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> a + b;
}</pre>
<p>This innocent-looking method has a lot to say in terms of CIL. First, the incoming arguments (a and
b) must be pushed onto the virtual execution stack using the ldarg (load argument) opcode. Next, the
add opcode will be used to pop the next two values off the stack and find the summation, and store the
value on the stack yet again. Finally, this sum is popped off the stack and returned to the caller via the
ret opcode. If you were to disassemble this C# method using ildasm.exe, you would find numerous
additional tokens injected by csc.exe, but the crux of the CIL code is quite simple:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig static int32 Add(int32 a,
    int32 b) cil managed
{
    .maxstack 2
    ldarg.0 // Load "a" onto the stack.
    ldarg.1 // Load "b" onto the stack.
    add // Add both values.
    ret
}
</pre>
<h2>The Hidden this Reference</h2>
<p>Notice that the two incoming arguments (a and b) are referenced within the CIL code using their indexed
position (index 0 and index 1), given that the virtual execution stack begins indexing at position 0.</p>
<p>One thing to be very mindful of when you are examining or authoring CIL code is that every
nonstatic method that takes incoming arguments automatically receives an implicit additional
parameter, which is a reference to the current object (think the C# this keyword). Given this, if the Add()
method were defined as nonstatic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// No longer static!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> a, <span class="kwrd">int</span> b)
{
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> a + b;
}</pre>
<p>the incoming a and b arguments are loaded using ldarg.1 and ldarg.2 (rather than the expected ldarg.0
and ldarg.1 opcodes). Again, the reason is that slot 0 actually contains the implicit this reference.
Consider the following pseudo-code:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// This is JUST pseudo-code!
.method public hidebysig static int32 AddTwoIntParams(
    MyClass_HiddenThisPointer this, int32 a, int32 b) cil managed
{
    ldarg.0 // Load MyClass_HiddenThisPointer onto the stack.
    ldarg.1 // Load "a" onto the stack.
    ldarg.2 // Load "b" onto the stack.
...
}
</pre>
<h2>Representing Iteration Constructs in CIL</h2>
<p>Iteration constructs in the C# programming language are represented using the for, foreach, while, and
do keywords, each of which has a specific representation in CIL. Consider the classic for loop:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> void CountToTen()
{
    <span class="kwrd">for</span>(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        ;
}</pre>
<p>Now, as you may recall, the br opcodes (br, blt, and so on) are used to control a break in flow when
some condition has been met. In this example, you have set up a condition in which the for loop should
break out of its cycle when the local variable i is equal to or greater than the value of 10. With each pass,
the value of 1 is added to i, at which point the test condition is yet again evaluated.</p>
<p>Also recall that when you make use of any of the CIL branching opcodes, you will need to define a
specific code label (or two) that marks the location to jump to when the condition is indeed true. Given
This book was purchased by max.sage@webitec.co.uk
these points, ponder the following (augmented) CIL code generated via ildasm.exe (including the
autogenerated code labels):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig static void CountToTen() cil managed
{
    .maxstack 2
    .locals init ([0] int32 i) // Init the local integer "i".
    IL_0000: ldc.i4.0 // Load this value onto the stack.
    IL_0001: stloc.0 // Store this value at index "0".
    IL_0002: br.s IL_0008 // Jump to IL_0008.
    IL_0004: ldloc.0 // Load value of variable at index 0.
    IL_0005: ldc.i4.1 // Load the value "1" on the stack.
    IL_0006: add // Add current value on the stack at index 0.
    IL_0007: stloc.0
    IL_0008: ldloc.0 // Load value at index "0".
    IL_0009: ldc.i4.s 10 // Load value of "10" onto the stack.
    IL_000b: blt.s IL_0004 // Less than? If so, jump back to IL_0004
    IL_000d: ret
}</pre>
<p>In a nutshell, this CIL code begins by defining the local int32 and loading it onto the stack. At this
point, you jump back and forth between code label IL_0008 and IL_0004, each time bumping the value of
i by 1 and testing to see whether i is still less than the value 10. If so, you exit the method.</p>
