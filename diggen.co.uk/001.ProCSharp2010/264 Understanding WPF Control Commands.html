<h1>Understanding WPF Control Commands</h1>
    <p>Windows Presentation Foundation provides support for what might be considered control-agnostic
events with control commands. A typical .NET event is defined within a specific base class and can only
be used by that class or a derivative thereof. Therefore, normal .NET events are tightly coupled to the
class in which they are defined.</p>
<p>In contrast, WPF control commands are event-like entities that are independent from a specific
control and, in many cases, can be successfully applied to numerous (and seemingly unrelated) control
types. By way of a few examples, WPF supports Copy, Paste, and Cut commands, which you can apply to
a wide variety of UI elements (e.g., menu items, toolbar buttons, and custom buttons), as well as
keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+C, and Ctrl+V).</p>
<p>While other UI toolkits (such as Windows Forms) provided standard events for such purposes, using
them typically left you with redundant and hard to maintain code. Under the WPF model, you can use
commands as an alternative. The end result typically yields a smaller and more flexible code base.</p>
<h2>The Intrinsic Control Command Objects</h2>
<p>WPF ships with numerous built-in control commands, all of which you can configure with associated
keyboard shortcuts (or other input gestures). Programmatically speaking, a WPF control command is
any object that supports a property (often called Command) that returns an object implementing the
ICommand interface, as shown here:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> ICommand
{
    <span class="rem">// Occurs when changes occur that affect whether</span>
    <span class="rem">// or not the command should execute.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">event</span> EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;

    <span class="rem">// Defines the method that determines whether the command</span>
    <span class="rem">// can execute in its current state.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> CanExecute(<span class="kwrd">object</span> parameter);

    <span class="rem">// Defines the method to be called when the command is invoked.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Execute(<span class="kwrd">object</span> parameter);
}</pre>
<p>While you could provide your own implementation of this interface to account for a control
command, the chances that you will need to do so are slim, given that the functionality provided by the
five WPF classes contains close to 100 command objects out-of-the-box. These classes define numerous
properties that expose specific command objects, each of which implements ICommand.</p>

<h2>Connecting Commands to the Command Property</h2>
<p>If you wish to connect any of these command properties to a UI element that supports the Command
property (such as a Button or MenuItem), you have little work to do. You can see how to do this by
updating the current menu system so it supports a new topmost menu item named Edit and three subitems
to account for copying, pasting, and cutting of textual data:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">

    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

    <span class="rem">&lt;!-- New menu item with commands! --&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Header</span><span class="kwrd">="_Edit"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Command</span> <span class="kwrd">="ApplicationCommands.Copy"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Command</span> <span class="kwrd">="ApplicationCommands.Paste"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Header</span><span class="kwrd">="_Tools"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Header</span> <span class="kwrd">="_Spelling Hints"</span>
            <span class="attr">MouseEnter</span> <span class="kwrd">="MouseEnterToolsHintsArea"</span>
            <span class="attr">MouseLeave</span> <span class="kwrd">="MouseLeaveArea"</span>
            <span class="attr">Click</span> <span class="kwrd">="ToolsSpellingHints_Click"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Menu</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Notice that each of the sub-items on the Edit menu has a value assigned to the Command property.
Doing this means that the menu items automatically receive the correct name and shortcut key (e.g.,
Ctrl+C for a cut operation) in the menu item UI; it also means that the application is now copy, cut, and
paste aware with no procedural code!</p>
<p>If you were to run the application and select some of your text, you would be able to use your new
menu items out-of-the-box. As a bonus, your application is also equipped to respond to a standard
right-click operation to present the user with the same options (Figure 28-15).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure20_05.png" alt="Figure 20-5" />
<p><b>Figure 28-15</b> Command objects provide a good deal of built-in functionality for free</p>
<h2>Connecting Commands to Arbitrary Actions</h2>
<p>If you wish to connect a command object to an arbitrary (application-specific) event, you will need to
drop down to procedural code. Doing so is not complex, but it does involve a bit more logic than you see
in XAML. For example, assume that want to have the entire window respond to the F1 key, so that when
the end user presses this key, he will activate an associated help system.</p>
<p>Also, assume your code file for the main window defines a new method named
SetF1CommandBinding(), which you call within the constructor after the call to InitializeComponent():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    SetF1CommandBinding();
}</pre>
<p>This new method will programmatically create a new CommandBinding object, which you can use
whenever you wish to bind a command object to a given event handler in your application. Here, you
configure your CommandBinding object to operate with the ApplicationCommands.Help command, which is
automatically F1-aware:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetF1CommandBinding()
{
    CommandBinding helpBinding = <span class="kwrd">new</span> CommandBinding(ApplicationCommands.Help);
    helpBinding.CanExecute += CanHelpExecute;
    helpBinding.Executed += HelpExecuted;
    CommandBindings.Add(helpBinding);
}</pre>
<p>Most CommandBinding objects will want to handle the CanExecute event (which allows you to specify
whether the command occurs based on the operation of your program) and the Executed event (which is
where you can author the content that should occur once the command occurs). Add the following event
handlers to your Window-derived type (note the format of each method, as required by the associated
delegates):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CanHelpExecute(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Here, you can set CanExecute to false if you wish to prevent the</span>
    <span class="rem">// command from executing.</span>
    e.CanExecute = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
}

<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> HelpExecuted(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Look, it is not that difficult. Just type something!"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Help!"</span>);
}</pre>
    <p>In the preceding snippet, you implemented CanHelpExecute() so it always allows F1 help to launch;
you do this by simply returning true. However, if you have certain situations where the help system
should not display, you can account for this and return false when necessary. Your “help system”
displayed within HelpExecuted() is little more than a message box. At this point, you can run your
application. When you press the F1 key on your keyboard, you will see your (less than helpful, if not a bit
insulting) user-guidance system (see Figure 28-16).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure28_16.png" alt="Figure 28-16" />
<p><b>Figure 28-16</b> Your custom help system (which is not quite as helpful as the user would hope)</p>
<h2>Working with the Open and Save Commands</h2>
<p>To complete the current example, you will add functionality to save your text data to an external file and
open up *.txt files for editing. If you want to take the long road, you can manually add programming
logic that enables or disables new menu items based on whether your TextBox has data inside it. Once
again, however, you can use commands to decrease your burden.</p>
<p>Begin by updating the &lt;MenuItem&gt; element that represents your topmost File menu by adding two
new submenus that use the Save and Open ApplicationCommands objects:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Header</span><span class="kwrd">="_File"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Command</span> <span class="kwrd">="ApplicationCommands.Open"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Command</span> <span class="kwrd">="ApplicationCommands.Save"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Separator</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span> <span class="attr">Header</span> <span class="kwrd">="_Exit"</span>
        <span class="attr">MouseEnter</span> <span class="kwrd">="MouseEnterExitArea"</span>
        <span class="attr">MouseLeave</span> <span class="kwrd">="MouseLeaveArea"</span> <span class="attr">Click</span> <span class="kwrd">="FileExit_Click"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">MenuItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Again, remember that all command objects implement the ICommand interface, which defines two
events (CanExecute and Executed). Now you need to enable the entire window, so it can check whether it
is currently OK to fire these commands; if so, you can define an event handler to execute the custom
code.</p>
<p>You do this by populating the CommandBindings collection maintained by the window. To do so in
XAML requires that you use property element syntax to define a &lt;Window.CommandBindings&gt; scope in
which you place two &lt;CommandBinding&gt; definitions. Update your &lt;Window&gt; like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Window</span> <span class="attr">x:Class</span><span class="kwrd">="MyWordPad.MainWindow"</span>
    <span class="attr">xmlns</span><span class="kwrd">="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"</span>
    <span class="attr">xmlns:x</span><span class="kwrd">="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"</span>
    <span class="attr">Title</span><span class="kwrd">="MySpellChecker"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="331"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="508"</span>
    <span class="attr">WindowStartupLocation</span> <span class="kwrd">="CenterScreen"</span> <span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

    <span class="rem">&lt;!-- This will inform the Window which handlers to call,</span>
<span class="rem">        when testing for the Open and Save commands. --&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Window.CommandBindings</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">CommandBinding</span> <span class="attr">Command</span><span class="kwrd">="ApplicationCommands.Open"</span>
            <span class="attr">Executed</span><span class="kwrd">="OpenCmdExecuted"</span>
            <span class="attr">CanExecute</span><span class="kwrd">="OpenCmdCanExecute"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">CommandBinding</span> <span class="attr">Command</span><span class="kwrd">="ApplicationCommands.Save"</span>
            <span class="attr">Executed</span><span class="kwrd">="SaveCmdExecuted"</span>
            <span class="attr">CanExecute</span><span class="kwrd">="SaveCmdCanExecute"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Window.CommandBindings</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

    <span class="rem">&lt;!-- This panel establishes the content for the window --&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">DockPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        ...
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">DockPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Window</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Now right-click each of the Executed and CanExecute attributes in your XAML editor and pick the
Navigate to Event Handler menu option. As you might recall from Chapter 27, this will automatically
generate stub code for the event itself. At this point, you should have four empty handlers in the C# code
file for the window.</p>
<p>The implementation of CanExecute event handlers will tell the window that it is OK to fire the
corresponding Executed events at any time by setting the CanExecute property of the incoming
CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OpenCmdCanExecute(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    e.CanExecute = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
}

<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SaveCmdCanExecute(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    e.CanExecute = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
}</pre>
<p>The corresponding Executed handlers perform the actual work of displaying the open and save
dialog boxes; they also send the data in your TextBox to a file. Begin by making sure that you import the
System.IO and Microsoft.Win32 namespaces into your code file. The completed code is straightforward:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OpenCmdExecuted(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Create an open file dialog box and only show XAML files.</span>
    OpenFileDialog openDlg = <span class="kwrd">new</span> OpenFileDialog();
    openDlg.Filter = <span class="str">"Text Files |*.txt"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Did they click on the OK button?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (<span class="kwrd">true</span> == openDlg.ShowDialog())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Load all text of selected file.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> dataFromFile = File.ReadAllText(openDlg.FileName);

        <span class="rem">// Show string in TextBox.</span>
        txtData.Text = dataFromFile;
    }
}

<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SaveCmdExecuted(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    SaveFileDialog saveDlg = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SaveFileDialog();
    saveDlg.Filter = <span class="str">"Text Files |*.txt"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Did they click on the OK button?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (<span class="kwrd">true</span> == saveDlg.ShowDialog())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Save data in the TextBox to the named file.</span>
        File.WriteAllText(saveDlg.FileName, txtData.Text);
    }
}</pre>
<p>That wraps up this example and your initial look at working with WPF controls. Here, you learned
how to work with menu systems, status bars, tool bars, nested panels, and a few basic UI controls, such
as TextBox and Expander. The next example will work with some more exotic controls, while examining
several important WPF services at the same time. As an added bonus, you will build the interface using
Expression Blend.</p>
