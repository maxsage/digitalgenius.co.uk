<h1>Investigating the WPF Assemblies</h1>
<p>Regardless of which type of WPF application you wish to build, WPF is ultimately little more than a
collection of types bundled within .NET assemblies. Table 27-3 describes the core assemblies used to
build WPF applications, each of which must be referenced when creating a new project (as you would
hope, Visual Studio 2010 and Expression Blend WPF projects automatically reference the required
assemblies).</p>
<p><b>Table 27-3.</b> Core WPF Assemblies</p>

<p>Collectively, these assemblies define a number of new namespaces and hundreds of new .NET
classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations, and delegates. While you should consult the .NET
Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for complete details, Table 27-4 describes the role of some (but
certainly not all) of the namespaces you should be aware of.</p>

<p>To begin your journey into the WPF programming model, you’ll examine two members of the
System.Windows namespace that are commonplace to any traditional desktop development effort:
Application and Window.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you are new to the development of desktop applications using the .NET platform, be aware that the
System.Windows.Forms.* and System.Drawing.* assemblies are not related to WPF! These libraries
represent the original .NET GUI toolkit, Windows Forms (see Appendix A).</p>
<h2>The Role of the Application Class</h2>
<p>The System.Windows.Application class represents a global instance of a running WPF application. This
class supplies a Run() method (to start the application), a series of events that you are able to handle in
order to interact with the application’s lifetime (such as Startup and Exit), and a number of events that
are specific to XAML browser applications (such as events that fire as a user navigates between pages).
Table 27-5 details some of the key properties to be aware of.</p>
<p><b>Table 27-5.</b> Key Properties of the Application Type</p>

   <td>
    This static property allows you to gain access to the running Application
object from anywhere in your code. This can be very helpful when a
window or dialog box needs to gain access to the Application object that
created it, typically to access application wide variables and
functionality.

  <tr>
   <td>
    Windows
   </td>
   <td>
    This property returns a WindowCollection type, which provides access to
each window created from the thread that created the Application
object. This can be very helpful when you wish to iterate over each open
window of an application and alter its state (such as minimizing all
windows).
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Constructing an Application Class</h2>
<p>Any WPF application will need to define a class that extends Application. Within this class, you will
define your program's entry point (the Main() method), which creates an instance of this subclass and
typically handles the Startup and Exit events. You will build a full example project in just a moment, but
here is a quick example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Define the global application object</span>
<span class="rem">// for this WPF program.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyApp : Application
{
    [STAThread]
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Create the application object.</span>
        MyApp app = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyApp();

        <span class="rem">// Register the Startup / Exit events.</span>
        app.Startup += (s, e) =&gt; { <span class="rem">/* Start up the app */</span> };
        app.Exit += (s, e) =&gt; { <span class="rem">/* Exit the app */</span> };
    }
}</pre>
<p>Within the Startup handler, you will most often process any incoming command line arguments
and launch the main window of the program. The Exit handler, as you would expect, is where you can
author any necessary shut down logic for the program (e.g., save user preferences, write to the Windows
registry).</p>
<h2>Enumerating the Application.Windows collection</h2>
<p>Another interesting property exposed by Application is Windows, which provides access to a collection
representing each window loaded into memory for the current WPF application. Recall that as you
create new Window objects, they are automatically added into the Application.Windows collection. Here is
an example method that will minimize each window of the application (perhaps in response to a given
keyboard gesture or menu option triggered by the end user):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MinimizeAllWindows()
{
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Window wnd <span class="kwrd">in</span> Application.Current.Windows)
    {
        wnd.WindowState = WindowState.Minimized;
    }
}</pre>
<p>You’ll build a complete Application-derived type in an upcoming example. Until then, let’s check
out the core functionality of the Window type and learn about a number of important WPF base classes in
the process.</p>
<h2>The Role of the Window Class</h2>
<p>The System.Windows.Window class represents a single window owned by the Application-derived class,
including any dialog boxes displayed by the main window. Not surprisingly, Window has a series of parent
classes, each of which brings more functionality to the table. Consider Figure 27-5, which shows the
inheritance chain (and implemented interfaces) for System.Windows.Window as seen through the Visual
Studio 2010 object browser.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure27_05.png" alt="Figure 27-5" />
<p><b>Figure 27-5</b> The hierarchy of the Window class</p>
<p>You’ll come to understand the functionality provided by many of these base classes as you progress
through this chapter and the chapters to come. However, to whet your appetite, the following sections
present a breakdown of the functionality provided by each base class (consult the .NET Framework 4.0
SDK documentation for full details).</p>
<h2>The Role of System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl</h2>
<p>The direct parent of Window is ContentControl, which is quite possibly the most enticing of all WPF
classes. This base class provides derived types with the ability to host a single piece of content, which,
simply put, refers to the data placed within the interior of the control’s surface area via the Content
property. The WPF content model makes it very simple to customize the basic look and feel of a content
control.</p>
<p>For example, when you think of a typical "button" control, you tend to assume that the content is a
basic string literal (OK, Cancel, Abort, etc). If you are using XAML to describe a WPF control, and the
value you wish to assign to the Content property can be captured as a simple string, you may set the
Content property within the element’s opening definition as so (don't fret over the exact markup at this
point):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Setting the Content value in the opening element --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="80"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="100"</span> <span class="attr">Content</span><span class="kwrd">="OK"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p><b>Note</b> The Content property can also be set in C# code, which allows you to change the interior of a control at
runtime.</p>
<p>However, content can be anything. For example, let's say you wish to have a "button" that has
something more interesting than a simple string, perhaps a custom graphic and a blurb of text. In other
UI frameworks such as Windows Forms, you would be required to build a custom control, which could
entail quite a bit of code and a whole new class to maintain. With the WPF content model, there is no
need to do so.</p>
<p>When you wish to assign to the Content property to a value which cannot be captured as a simple
array of characters, you are unable to assign the Content property using an attribute in the control’s
opening definition. Rather, you must define the content data implicitly, within the element's scope. For
example, this &lt;Button&gt; contains a &lt;StackPanel&gt; as content, which itself contains some unique data (an
&lt;Ellipse&gt; and &lt;Label&gt;, to be exact):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Implicitly setting the Content property with complex data --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="80"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="100"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Ellipse</span> <span class="attr">Fill</span><span class="kwrd">="Red"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="25"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="25"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">Content</span> <span class="kwrd">="OK!"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Button</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>You can also make use of XAML's property-element syntax to set complex content. Consider the
following functionally equivalent &lt;Button&gt; definition, which sets the Content property explicitly using
property-element syntax (again, you’ll find more information on XAML later in this chapter, so don’t
sweat the details just yet):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Setting the Content property using property element syntax --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="80"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="100"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button.Content</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
            <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Ellipse</span> <span class="attr">Fill</span><span class="kwrd">="Red"</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="25"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="25"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
            <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">Content</span> <span class="kwrd">="OK!"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button.Content</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Button</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Do be aware that not every WPF control derives from ContentControl, and therefore not all controls
supports this unique content model. As well, some WPF controls add a few refinements to the basic
content model you have just examined. Chapter 28 will examine the role of WPF content in much more
detail.</p>
<h2>The Role of System.Windows.Controls.Control</h2>
<p>Unlike ContentControl, all WPF controls share the Control base class as a common parent. This base
class provides numerous core members that account for basic UI functionality. For example, Control
defines properties to establish the control’s size, opacity, tab order logic, the display cursor, background
color, and so forth. Furthermore, this parent class provides support for templating services. As explained
in Chapter 31, WPF controls can completely change the way they render their appearance using
templates and styles. Table 27-6 documents some key members of the Control type, grouped by related
functionality.</p>

</table>
<h2>The Role of System.Windows.FrameworkElement</h2>
<p>This base class provides a number of members that are used throughout the WPF framework, such as
support for storyboarding (used within animations) and support for data binding, as well as the ability to
name a member (via the Name property), obtain any resources defined by the derived type, and establish
the overall dimensions of the derived type. Table 27-7 hits the highlights.</p>

<h2>The Role of System.Windows.UIElement</h2>
<p>Of all the types within a Window’s inheritance chain, the UIElement base class provides the greatest
amount of functionality. The key task of UIElement is to provide the derived type with numerous events
to allow the derived type to receive focus and process input requests. For example, this class provides
numerous events to account for drag-and-drop operations, mouse movement, keyboard input, and
stylus input (for Pocket PCs and Tablet PCs).</p>
<p>Chapter 29 digs into the WPF event model in detail; however, many of the core events will look quite
familiar (MouseMove, KeyUp, MouseDown, MouseEnter, MouseLeave, etc.). In addition to defining dozens of
events, this parent class provides a number of properties to account for control focus, enabled state,
visibility, and hit testing logic, as shown in Table 27-8.</p>
<p><b>Table 27-8.</b> Key Members of the UIElement Type</p>

    This property allows you to control whether a given derived type
is enabled or disabled.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsMouseDirectlyOver, IsMouseOver
   </td>
   <td>
    These properties provide a simple way to perform hit-testing
logic.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsVisible, Visibility
   </td>
   <td>
    These properties allow you to work with the visibility setting of a
derived type.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    RenderTransform
   </td>
   <td>
    This property allows you to establish a transformation that will
be used to render the derived type.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>The Role of System.Windows.Media.Visual</h2>
<p>The Visual class type provides core rendering support in WPF, which includes hit testing of rendered
data, coordinate transformation, and bounding box calculations. In fact, the Visual class interacts with
the underlying DirectX subsystem to actually draw data on the screen. As examined in Chapter 29, WPF
provides three possible manners in which you can render graphical data, each of which differs in terms
of functionality and performance. Use of the Visual type (and its children, such as DrawingVisual)
provides the most lightweight way to render graphical data, but it also entails the greatest amount of
manual code to account for all the required services. Again, more details to come in Chapter 29.</p>
<h2>The Role of System.Windows.DependencyObject</h2>
<p>WPF supports a particular flavor of .NET properties termed dependency properties. Simply put, this
approach allows a type to compute the value of a property based on the value of other properties. In
order for a type to participate in this new property scheme, it will need to derive from the
DependencyObject base class. In addition, DependencyObject allows derived types to support attached
properties, which are a form of dependency property very useful when programming against the WPF
data-binding model as well as when laying out UI elements within various WPF panel types.</p>
<p>The DependencyObject base class provides two key methods to all derived types: GetValue() and
SetValue(). Using these members, you are able to establish the property itself. Other bits of
infrastructure allow you to “register” who can use the dependency/attached property in question. While
dependency properties are a key aspect of WPF development, much of the time their details are hidden
from view. Chapter 29 dives further into the details of the “new” property type.</p>
<h2>The Role of System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject</h2>
<p>The final base class of the Window type (beyond System.Object, which I assume needs no further
explanation at this point in the book) is DispatcherObject. This type provides one property of interest,
Dispatcher, which returns the associated System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher object. The Dispatcher
class is the entry point to the event queue of the WPF application, and it provides the basic constructs for
dealing with concurrency and threading. By and large, this is a lower-level class that can be ignored by
the majority of your WPF applications.</p>
