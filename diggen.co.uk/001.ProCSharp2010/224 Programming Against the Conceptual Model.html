<h1>Programming Against the Conceptual Model</h1>
    <p>Now you can author some code that interacts with your EDM. Begin by updating your Program class to
call a helper method from Main(), which will print out each item in the Inventory database using your
conceptual model, and another which will insert a new record to the Inventory table:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with ADO.NET EF *****"</span>);
        AddNewRecord();
        PrintAllInventory();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddNewRecord()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Add record to the Inventory table of the AutoLot</span>
        <span class="rem">// database.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
        {
            <span class="kwrd">try</span>
            {
                <span class="rem">// Hard code data for a new record, for testing.</span>
                context.Cars.AddObject(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Car() { CarID = 2222,
                    Make = <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Brown"</span> });
                context.SaveChanges();
            }
            <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.InnerException.Message);
            }
        }
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintAllInventory()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Select all items from the Inventory table of AutoLot,</span>
        <span class="rem">// and print out the data using our custom ToString()</span>
        <span class="rem">// of the Car entity class.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
        {
            <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Cars)
            Console.WriteLine(c);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>You have seen code similar to this earlier in the chapter, but now you should have a much better
idea about how it works. Each helper method creates an instance of the ObjectContext derived class
(AutoLotEntities), and uses the strongly typed Cars property to interact with the ObjectSet&lt;Car&gt; field.
Enumerating each item exposed by the Cars property enables you to submit a SQL SELECT statement
indirectly to the underlying ADO.NET data provider. By inserting a new Car object with the AddObject()
method of ObjectSet&lt;Car&gt;, and then calling SaveChanges() on the context, you have preformed a SQL
INSERT.</p>
<h2>Deleting a Record</h2>
<p>When you wish to remove a record from the database, you will first need to locate the correct item in the
ObjectSet&lt;T&gt;, which you can find by passing an EntityKey object (which is a member of the System.Data
namespace) to the GetObjectByKey() method. Assuming you have imported this namespace into your C#
code file, you can now author the following helper method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> RemoveRecord()
{
    <span class="rem">// Find a car to delete by primary key.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Define a key for the entity we are looking for.</span>
        EntityKey key = <span class="kwrd">new</span> EntityKey(<span class="str">"AutoLotEntities.Cars"</span>, <span class="str">"CarID"</span>, 2222);

        <span class="rem">// See if we have it, and delete it if we do.</span>
        Car carToDelete = (Car)context.GetObjectByKey(key);
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (carToDelete != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        {
            context.DeleteObject(carToDelete);
            context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> For better or for worse, calling GetObjectByKey() requires a roundtrip to the database before you can
delete the object.</p>
<p>Notice that when you are creating an EntityKey object, you need use a string object to inform it
which ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; to evaluate in a given ObjectContext derived class. The second argument is another
string; this one represents the property name on the entity class that is marked as the key, and the final
constructor argument is the value of the primary key. Once you find the object in question, you can call
DeleteObject() off your context and save the changes.</p>
<h2>Updating a Record</h2>
<p>Updating a record is also straightforward; locate the object you wish to change, set new property values
on the returned entity, and save the changes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UpdateRecord()
{
    <span class="rem">// Find a car to delete by primary key.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Define a key for the entity we are looking for.</span>
        EntityKey key = <span class="kwrd">new</span> EntityKey(<span class="str">"AutoLotEntities.Cars"</span>, <span class="str">"CarID"</span>, 2222);

        <span class="rem">// Grab the car, change it, save!</span>
        Car carToUpdate = (Car)context.GetObjectByKey(key);
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (carToUpdate != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        {
            carToUpdate.Color = <span class="str">"Blue"</span>;
            context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>The preceding method might seem a bit off, at least until you remember that the entity object
returned from GetObjectByKey() is a reference to an existing object in the ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; field. Thus,
when you set properties to change the state, you are changing the same object in memory.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Much like an ADO.NET DataRow object (see Chapter 22), any descendent of EntityObject (meaning, all
of your entity classes) has a property named EntityState, which is used by the object context to determine
whether the item has been modified, deleted, is detached, and so forth. This is set on your behalf as you work with
the programming model; however, you can change this manually as required.</p>
<h2>Querying with LINQ to Entities</h2>
<p>So far, you have been working with a few simple methods on the object context and entity objects to
perform selections, inserts, updates, and deletes. This is useful all by itself; however, EF becomes much
more powerful when you incorporate LINQ queries. If you wish to use LINQ to update or delete records,
you don’t need to make an EntityKey object manually. Consider the following update to the
RemoveRecord() method, which will not work as expected at this point:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> RemoveRecord()
{
    <span class="rem">// Find a car to delete by primary key.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="rem">// See if we have it?</span>
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> carToDelete = <span class="kwrd">from</span> c <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Cars where c.CarID == 2222 select c;

        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (carToDelete != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        {
            context.DeleteObject(carToDelete);
            context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>This code compiles, but you will receive a runtime exception when you attempt to call the
DeleteObject() method. The reason: This particular LINQ query returns an ObjectQuery&lt;T&gt; object, not a
Car object. Always remember that when you build a LINQ query that attempts to locate a single entity,
you will get back an ObjectQuery&lt;T&gt; representing a query that is capable of bringing back the data you
are looking for. To execute the query (and bring back the Car entity), you must execute a method such as
FirstOrDefault() on the query object, as in the following example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">var</span> carToDelete =
(<span class="kwrd">from</span> c <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Cars where c.CarID == 2222 select c).FirstOrDefault();</pre>
<p>By calling FirstOrDefault() on the ObjectQuery&lt;T&gt;, you find the item you want; or, if there is no Car
with the ID of 2222, a default value of null.</p> 
<p>Given that you have already worked with many LINQ expressions in Chapter 13, a few more
examples will suffice for the time being:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> FunWithLINQQueries()
{
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get a projection of new data.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> colorsMakes = <span class="kwrd">from</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Cars select
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> { item.Color, item.Make };
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> colorsMakes)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }

        <span class="rem">// Get only items where CarID &lt; 1000</span>
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> idsLessThan1000 = <span class="kwrd">from</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Cars
            where item.CarID &lt; 1000 select item;
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> idsLessThan1000)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>While the syntax of these queries is simple enough, remember that you are hitting a database each
time you apply a LINQ query to the object context! Recall that when you wish to obtain an independent
copy of data, which can be the target of new LINQ queries, you want to use immediate execution with
the ToList&lt;T&gt;(), ToArray&lt;T&gt;() or ToDictionary&lt;K,V&gt;() extension methods (among others). Here is an
update of the previous method, which performs the equivalent of a SELECT *, caches the entities as an
array, and manipulates the array data using LINQ to Objects:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
{
    <span class="rem">// Get all data from the Inventory table.</span>
    <span class="rem">// could also write:</span>
    <span class="rem">// var allData = (from item in context.Cars select item).ToArray();</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> allData = context.Cars.ToArray();

    <span class="rem">// Get a projection of new data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> colorsMakes = <span class="kwrd">from</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> allData select <span class="kwrd">new</span> { item.Color, item.Make };

    <span class="rem">// Get only items where CarID &lt; 1000</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> idsLessThan1000 = <span class="kwrd">from</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> allData where
        item.CarID &lt; 1000 select item;
}</pre>
<p>Working with LINQ to Entities is much more enticing when your EDM contains multiple related
tables. You’ll see some example that illustrate this in a moment; however, let’s wrap up this current
example by looking at two other ways you can interact with your object context.</p>
<h2>Querying with Entity SQL</h2>
<p>To be sure, you will be querying and ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; with LINQ a majority of the time. The entity client will
break down your LINQ query into a fitting SQL statement, passing it onto the database for processing.
However, you can use Entity SQL if you wish to have more control over how the query is formatted.</p>
<p>Entity SQL is a SQL-like query language that can be applied to entities. While the format of an Entity
SQL statement is similar to a traditional SQL statement, it is not identical. Entity SQL has a unique syntax
because the entities receive the query, not the physical database. Like a LINQ to Entities query, an Entity
SQL query is used to pass a “real” SQL query to the database.</p>
<p>This chapter will not dive into the details of building Entity SQL commands, so please consult the
.NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation if you want more information. However, one example might
be helpful. Consider the following method, which builds an Entity SQL statement that finds all black cars
in the ObjectSet&lt;Car&gt; collection:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> FunWithEntitySQL()
{
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Build a string containing Entity SQL syntax.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> query = <span class="str">"SELECT VALUE car FROM AutoLotEntities.Cars "</span> +
            <span class="str">"AS car WHERE car.Color='black'"</span>;

        <span class="rem">// Now build a ObjectQuery&lt;T&gt; based on the string.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> blackCars = context.CreateQuery&lt;Car&gt;(query);
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> blackCars)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that you pass in the formatted Entity SQL statement as an argument to the CreateQuery&lt;T&gt;
method of your object context.</p>
<h2>Working with the Entity Client Data Reader Object</h2>
<p>When you use LINQ to Entities or Entity SQL, the fetched data is mapped back to your entity classes
automatically, thanks to the entity client service. Typically this is exactly what you require; however, you
can intercept the result set before it makes its way to your entity objects and process it manually using
the EntityDataReader.</p>
<p>Here is a final helper method for this example, which uses several members of the
System.Data.EntityClient namespace to build a connection manually through a command object and
data reader. This code should look familiar due to your previous work in Chapter 21; the major
difference is that you use Entity SQL, rather than “normal” SQL:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> FunWithEntityDataReader()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a connection object, based on our *.config file.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (EntityConnection cn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> EntityConnection(<span class="str">"name=AutoLotEntities"</span>))
    {
        cn.Open();

        <span class="rem">// Now build an Entity SQL query.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> query = <span class="str">"SELECT VALUE car FROM AutoLotEntities.Cars AS car"</span>;

        <span class="rem">// Create a command object.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (EntityCommand cmd = cn.CreateCommand())
        {
            cmd.CommandText = query;

            <span class="rem">// Finally, get the data reader and process records.</span>
            <span class="kwrd">using</span> (EntityDataReader dr =
                cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.SequentialAccess))
            {
                while (dr.Read())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** RECORD *****"</span>);
                    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID: {0}"</span>, dr[<span class="str">"CarID"</span>]);
                    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Make: {0}"</span>, dr[<span class="str">"Make"</span>]);
                    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Color: {0}"</span>, dr[<span class="str">"Color"</span>]);
                    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Pet Name: {0}"</span>, dr[<span class="str">"CarNickname"</span>]);
                    Console.WriteLine();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Great! This initial example should go a long way toward helping you understand the nuts and bolts
of working with the Entity Framework. As mentioned previously, things become much more interesting
when your EDM contains interrelated tables, which you will learn about next.</p>
