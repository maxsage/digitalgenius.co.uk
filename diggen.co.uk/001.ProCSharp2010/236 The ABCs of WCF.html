<h1>The ABCs of WCF</h1>
   <p>Hosts and clients communicate with each other by agreeing on the ABCs, a friendly mnemonic for
remembering the core building blocks of a WCF application address, binding, and contract:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Address: Describes the location of the service. In code, you represent this with a
System.Uri type; however, you typically store the value in *.config files.</li>
 <li>Binding: WCF ships with a many different bindings that specify network protocols,
encoding mechanisms, and the transport layer.</li>
 <li>Contract: Provides a description of each method exposed from the WCF service.  </li>
</ul>
  <p>You should realize that the ABC abbreviation does not imply that a developer must define the
address first, followed by binding, and ending with the contract. In many cases, a WCF developer begins
by defining a contract for the service, followed by establishing an address and bindings (any order will
do, as long as each aspect is accounted for). Before you build your first WCF application, you will take a
more detailed walk through of the ABCs.</p>
<h2>Understanding WCF Contracts</h2>
<p>Understanding the notion of a contract is the key to building a WCF service. While not mandatory, the
vast majority of your WCF applications will begin by defining a set of .NET interface types that are used
to represent the set of members a given WCF service will support. Specifically, interfaces that represent a
WCF contract are called service contracts. The classes (or structures) that implement them are called
service types.</p>
<p>WCF service contracts are adorned with various attributes, the most common of which are defined
in the System.ServiceModel namespace. When the members of a service contract (the methods in the
interface) contain only simple data types (e.g., numerical data, Booleans, and string data), you can build
a complete WCF service using nothing more than the [ServiceContract] and [OperationContract]
attributes.</p>
<p>However, if your members expose custom types, you will need to use types in the
System.Runtime.Serialization namespace (see Figure 25-5) of the System.Runtime.Serialization.dll
assembly. Here you will find additional attributes (e.g., [DataMember] and [DataContract]) to fine-tune
the process of defining how your composite types are serialized to and from XML when they are passed
to and from service operations.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, you are not required to use CLR interfaces to define a WCF contract. Many of these
same attributes can be applied on public members of a public class (or structure). However, given the
many benefits of interface-based programming (e.g., polymorphism and elegant versioning), it is safe to
consider using CLR interfaces to describe a WCF contract a best practice.</p>

<p><b>Figure 25-5</b> System.Runtime.Serialization defines a number of attributes used when building WCF data
contracts</p>
<h2>Understanding WCF Bindings</h2>
<p>Once you define and implement a contract (or a set of contracts) in your service library, the next logical
step is to build a hosting agent for the WCF service itself. As mentioned previously, you have a variety of
possible hosts to choose from, all of which must specify the bindings used by remote callers to gain
access to the service type’s functionality.</p>
<p>Choosing a set of bindings is one area that makes WCF development quite different from .NET
remoting and/or XML web service development. WCF ships with many of binding choices, each of
which is tailored to a specific need. If none of the out-of-the-box bindings fits the bill, you can create
your own by extending the CustomBinding type (something you will not do in this chapter). A WCF
binding can specify the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The transport layer used to move data (HTTP, MSMQ, named pipes, and TCP)</li>
 <li>The channels used by the transport (one-way, request-reply, and duplex)</li>
 <li>The encoding mechanism used to deal with the data itself (e.g., XML and binary)</li>
 </ul>
  <p>Any supported web service protocols (if permitted by the binding), such as WSSecurity,
WS-Transactions, WS-Reliability, and so on</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at your basic choices.</p>
<h2>HTTP-Based Bindings</h2>
<p>The BasicHttpBinding, WSHttpBinding, WSDualHttpBinding, and WSFederationHttpBinding options are
geared toward exposing contract types through XML web service protocols. If you require the furthest
reach possible for your service (e.g., multiple operating systems and multiple programming
architectures), you want to focus on these bindings because all of these binding types encode data based
on XML representation and use HTTP on the wire.</p>
<p>Table 25-3 shows note how you can represent a WCF binding in code (using class types within the
System.ServiceModel namespace) or as XML attributes defined within *.config files.</p>
<p><b>Table 25-3.</b> The HTTP-Centric WCF Bindings</p>

service. This binding uses HTTP as the
transport and Text/XML as the default
message encoding

    &lt;wsHttpBinding&gt;

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    WSDualHttpBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;wsDualHttpBinding&gt;
   </td>
   <td>
    This is similar to WSHttpBinding, but
intended for use with duplex contracts
(e.g., the service and client can send
messages back and forth). This binding
supports only SOAP security and
requires reliable messaging.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    WSFederationHttpBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;wsFederationHttpBinding&gt;
   </td>
   <td>
    This is a secure and interoperable
binding that supports the WSFederation
protocol, enabling
organizations that are in a federation to
authenticate and authorize users
efficiently.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>As its name suggests, BasicHttpBinding is the simplest of all web service–centric protocols.
Specifically, this binding ensures that your WCF service conforms to a specification named WS-I Basic
Profile 1.1 (defined by WS-I). The main reason to use this binding is for maintaining backward
compatibility with applications that were previously built to communicate with ASP.NET web services
(which have been part of the .NET libraries since version 1.0).</p>
<p>The WSHttpBinding protocol not only incorporates support for a subset of the WS-* specification
(transactions, security, and reliable sessions), but also supports the ability to handle binary data
encoding using Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).</p>
<p>The main benefit of WSDualHttpBinding is that it adds the ability to allow the caller and sender to
communicate using duplex messaging, which is a fancy way of saying they can engage in a two-way
conversation. When selecting WSDualHttpBinding, you can hook into the WCF publish/subscribe event
model.</p>
<p>Finally, WSFederationHttpBinding is the web service–based protocol you might wish to consider
when security among a group of organizations is of the utmost importance. This binding supports the
WS-Trust, WS-Security, and WS-SecureConversation specifications, which are represented by the WCF
CardSpace APIs.</p>
<h2>TCP-Based Bindings</h2>
<p>If you build a distributed application involving machines that are configured with the .NET 4.0 libraries
(in other words, all machines are running the Windows operating system), you can gain performance
benefits by bypassing web service bindings and opting for a TCP binding, which ensures that all data is
encoded in a compact binary format, rather than XML. Again, when you use the bindings shown in
Table 25-4, the client and host must be .NET applications.</p>

   <td>
    NetNamedPipeBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;netNamedPipeBinding&gt;
   </td>
      <td>
    Serves as a secure, reliable, optimized binding
for on-the-same-machine communication
between .NET applications.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    NetPeerTcpBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;netPeerTcpBinding&gt;
   </td>
      <td>
    Provides a secure binding for P2P network
applications.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    NetTcpBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;netTcpBinding&gt;
   </td>
      <td>
    Serves as a secure and optimized binding
suitable for cross-machine communication
between .NET applications.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The NetTcpBinding class uses TCP to move binary data between the client and WCF service. As
mentioned previously, this will result in higher performance than the web service protocols, but limits
you to an in-house Windows solution. On the plus side, NetTcpBinding supports transactions, reliable
sessions, and secure communications.</p>
<p>Like NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding supports transactions, reliable sessions, and secure
communications; however, it has no ability to make cross-machine calls. If you want to find the fastest
way to push data between WCF applications on the same machine (e.g., cross-application domain
communications), NetNamedPipeBinding is the binding choice of champions. For more information on
NetPeerTcpBinding, consult the .NET Framework 4.0 documentation for details regarding P2P
networking.</p>
<h2>MSMQ-Based Bindings</h2>
<p>Finally, the NetMsmqBinding and MsmqIntegrationBinding bindings are of immediate interest if you want
to integrate with a Microsoft MSMQ server. This chapter will not examine the details of using MSMQ
bindings, but Table 25-5 documents the basic role of each.</p>
<p><b>Table 25-5.</b> The MSMQ-Centric WCF Bindings</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Binding Class
   </th>
   <th>

   <th>

   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    MsmqIntegrationBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;msmqIntegrationBinding&gt;
   </td>
   <td>
    You can use this binding to enable WCF
applications to send and receive messages to
and from existing MSMQ applications that
use COM, native C++, or the types defined in
the System. Messaging namespace.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    NetMsmqBinding
   </td>
   <td>
    &lt;netMsmqBinding&gt;
   </td>
   <td>
    You can use this queued binding for crossmachine
communication between .NET
applications. This is the preferred approach
among the MSMQ-centric bindings.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Understanding WCF Addresses</h2>
<p>Once you establish the contracts and bindings, the final piece of the puzzle is to specify an address for
the WCF service. This is important because remote callers will be unable to communicate with the
remote types if they cannot locate them! Like most aspects of WCF, an address can be hard-coded in an
assembly (using the System.Uri type) or offloaded to a *.config file.</p>
<p>In either case, the exact format of the WCF address will differ based on your choice of binding
(HTTP based, named pipes, TCP based, or MSMQ based). From a high level, WCF addresses can specify
the following bits of information:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Scheme: The transport protocol (e.g., HTTP)</li>
  <li>MachineName: The fully qualified domain of the machine</li>
  <li>Port: This is optional in many cases; for example, the default for HTTP bindings is port 80.</li>
  <li>Path: The path to the WCF service</li>
</ul>
<p>This information can be represented by the following generalized template (the Port value is
optional because some bindings don’t use them):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
scheme://<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">MachineName</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>[:Port]/Path</pre>
<p>When you use a web service–based binding (e.g., basicHttpBinding, wsHttpBinding,
wsDualHttpBinding, or wsFederationHttpBinding), the address breaks down like this (recall that HTTPbased
protocols default to port 80 if you do not specify a port number):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
http://localhost:8080/MyWCFService</pre>
<p>If you use TCP-centric bindings (e.g., NetTcpBinding or NetPeerTcpBinding), the URI takes the
following format:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
net.tcp://localhost:8080/MyWCFService</pre>
<p>The MSMQ-centric bindings (NetMsmqBinding and MsmqIntegrationBinding) are unique in their URI
format because MSMQ can use public or private queues (which are available only on the local machine),
and port numbers have no meaning in an MSMQ-centric URI. Consider the following URI, which
describes a private queue named MyPrivateQ:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
net.msmq://localhost/private$/MyPrivateQ</pre>
<p>Last but not least, the address format used for the named-pipe binding, NetNamedPipeBinding,
breaks down like this (recall that named pipes allow for interprocess communication for applications on
the same physical machine):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
net.pipe://localhost/MyWCFService</pre>
<p>While a single WCF service might expose only a single address (based on a single binding), it is
possible to configure a collection of unique addresses (with different bindings). You can do this in a
*.config file by defining multiple &lt;endpoint7gt; elements. Here, you can specify any number of ABCs for
the same service. This approach can be helpful when you want to allow callers to select which protocol
they would like to use when communicating with the service.</p>
