<h1>The ASP.NET Web Site Directory Structure</h1>
    <p>When you create a new ASP.NET Web Site project, your project may contain any number of specifically
named subdirectories, each of which has a special meaning to the ASP.NET runtime. Table 32-3
documents these special subdirectories.</p>

   </td>
   <td>
    <p>Folder for compiled private assemblies (*.dll files). Assemblies in the
Bin folder are automatically referenced by your application</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If you are interested in adding any of these known subfolders to your current web application, you
may do so explicitly using the Website &gt; Add Folder menu option. However, in many cases, the IDE will
automatically do so as you naturally insert related files into your site. For example, inserting a new class
file into your project will automatically add an App_Code folder to your directory structure if one does
not currently exist.</p>
<h2>Referencing Assemblies</h2>
<p>Although the Web Site templates do generate an *.sln file to load your *.aspx files into the IDE, there is
no longer a related *.csproj file. However, an ASP.NET Web Application projects records all external
assemblies within *.csproj. So where are the external assemblies recorded under ASP.NET?</p>
<p>As you have seen, when you reference a private assembly, Visual Studio 2010 will automatically
create a \bin directory within your directory structure to store a local copy of the binary. When your code
base makes use of types within these code libraries, they are automatically loaded on demand.</p>
<p>If you reference a shared assembly located in the Global Assembly Cache, Visual Studio 2010 will
automatically insert a Web.config file into your current web solution (if one is not currently in place) and
record the external reference within the &lt;assemblies&gt; element. For example, if you again activate the
Web Site &gt; Add Reference menu option and this time select a shared assembly (such as
System.Data.OracleClient.dll), you will find that your Web.config file has been updated as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">assemblies</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">assembly</span><span class="kwrd">="System.Data.OracleClient, Version=4.0.0.0,
        Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=B03F5F7F11D50A3A"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">assemblies</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>As you can see, each assembly is described using the same information required for a dynamic load
via the Assembly.Load() method (see Chapter 15).</p>
<h2>The Role of the App_Code Folder</h2>
<p>The App_Code folder is used to store source code files that are not directly tied to a specific web page
(such as a code-behind file) but are to be compiled for use by your website. Code within the App_Code
folder will be automatically compiled on the fly on an as-needed basis. After this point, the assembly is
accessible to any other code in the website. To this end, the App_Code folder is much like the Bin folder,
except that you can store source code in it instead of compiled code. The major benefit of this approach
is that it is possible to define custom types for your web application without having to compile them
independently.</p>
<p>A single App_Code folder can contain code files from multiple languages. At runtime, the
appropriate compiler kicks in to generate the assembly in question. If you would rather partition your
code, however, you can define multiple subdirectories that are used to hold any number of managed
code files (*.vb, *.cs, etc.).</p>
<p>For example, assume you have added an App_Code folder to the root directory of a website
application that has two subfolders, MyCSharpCode and MyVbNetCode, that contain language-specific
files. Once you do, you are able to update your Web.config file to specify these subdirectories using a
&lt;codeSubDirectories&gt; element nested within the &lt;configuration&gt; element:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">compilation</span> <span class="attr">debug</span><span class="kwrd">="true"</span> <span class="attr">strict</span><span class="kwrd">="false"</span> <span class="attr">explicit</span><span class="kwrd">="true"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">codeSubDirectories</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">directoryName</span><span class="kwrd">="MyCSharpCode"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">directoryName</span><span class="kwrd">="MyVbNetCode"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">codeSubDirectories</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">compilation</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> The App_Code directory will also be used to contain files that are not language files but are useful
nonetheless (*.xsd files, *.wsdl files, etc.).</p>
<p>Beyond Bin and App_Code, the App_Data and App_Themes folders are two additional special
subdirectories that you should be familiar with, both of which will be detailed in the next several
chapters. As always, consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details of the
remaining ASP.NET subdirectories if you require further information.</p>
