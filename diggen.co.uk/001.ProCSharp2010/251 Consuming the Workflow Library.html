<h1>Consuming the Workflow Library</h1>
<p>Any sort of application can make use of a workflow library; however, here you will opt for simplicity and
build a simple Console Application named WorkflowLibraryClient. Once you make the project, you will
need to set a reference not only to your CheckInventoryWorkflowLib.dll and AutoLot.dll assemblies, but
also the key WF 4.0 library, System.Activities.dll, which can be found in the .NET tab of the Visual
Studio 2010 Add Reference dialog.</p>
<p>Once each assembly reference has been set, update your Program.cs file with the following logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Activities;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> CheckInventoryWorkflowLib;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> WorkflowLibraryClient
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"**** Inventory Look up ****"</span>);

            <span class="rem">// Get user preferences.</span>
            Console.Write(<span class="str">"Enter Color: "</span>);
            <span class="kwrd">string</span> color = Console.ReadLine();
            Console.Write(<span class="str">"Enter Make: "</span>);
            <span class="kwrd">string</span> make = Console.ReadLine();

            <span class="rem">// Package up data for workflow.</span>
            Dictionary&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">object</span>&gt; wfArgs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Dictionary&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">object</span>&gt;()
            {
                {<span class="str">"RequestedColor"</span>, color},
                {<span class="str">"RequestedMake"</span>, make}
            };
            <span class="kwrd">try</span>
            {
                <span class="rem">// Send data to workflow!</span>
                WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(<span class="kwrd">new</span> CheckInventory(), wfArgs);
            }
            <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>As you have done in other examples, you are using the WorkflowInvoker to spin off the workflow in a
synchronous manner. While this is all well and good, how are you to get back the return value of the
workflow? Remember, once the workflow terminates, you should get back a formatted response!</p>
<h2>Retrieving the Workflow Output Argument</h2>
<p>The WorkflowInvoker.Invoke() method will return an object implementing the IDictionary&lt;string,
object&gt; interface. Because a workflow can return back any number of output arguments, you will need
to specify the name of a given output argument as a string value to the type indexer. Update your
try/catch logic as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">try</span>
{
    <span class="rem">// Send data to workflow!</span>
    IDictionary&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">object</span>&gt; outputArgs =
        WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(<span class="kwrd">new</span> CheckInventory(), wfArgs);

    <span class="rem">// Print out the output message.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(outputArgs[<span class="str">"FormattedResponse"</span>]);
}
<span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}</pre>
<p>Now, run your program and enter a make and color which is currently in your copy of the Inventory
table of the AutoLot database. You’ll see output such as the following:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
**** Inventory Look up ****
Enter Color: Black
Enter Make: BMW
Yes sir! We can send you Black BMW as soon as 2/17/2010 9:23:01 PM!
Press any key to continue . . .</pre>
<p>However, if you enter information for an item not currently in stock, you will not only see output
such as:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
**** Inventory Look up ****
Enter Color: Pea Soup Green
Enter Make: Viper
Sorry, out of stock
Press any key to continue . . .</pre>
<p>You will also find a new *.txt file in the \bin\Debug folder of the client application. If you open this
in any text editor, you’ll find the “sales memo”:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
***** Attention sales team! *****
Please order the following ASAP!
1 Pea Soup Green Viper
*********************************</pre>
<p>That wraps up your introductory look at the brand new WF 4.0 API. As mentioned at the opening of
this chapter, if you have worked with the previous version of the Windows Workflow Foundation API,
you can clearly see the entire programming model has been overhauled completely (for the better, in my
opinion).</p>
<p>While this chapter has only touched on some of the key aspects of this .NET 4.0 API, I do hope you
feel confident that you can dive into the topic further if you are interested.</p>
