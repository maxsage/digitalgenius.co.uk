<h1>Building an Extendable Application</h1>
    <p>In the sections that follow, I will take you through a complete example that illustrates the process of
building an extendable Windows Forms application that can be augmented by the functionality of
external assemblies. What I will not do at this point is comment on the process of building GUI
applications with this tried and true desktop API (see Appendix A for an overview of the Windows Forms
API).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Windows Forms was the initial desktop API of the .NET platform. However, since the release of .NET 3.0,
the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) API is quickly becoming preferred GUI framework. While this is true, I
will make use of Windows Forms for a number of client UI examples in this text, as the related code is a tad bit
more intuitive than the corresponding WPF code.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with the process of building Windows Forms applications, feel free to simply
open up the supplied sample code and follow along. To serve as a road map, our extendable application
entails the following assemblies:</p>
<ul>
 <li>CommonSnappableTypes.dll: This assembly contains type definitions that will be
used by each snap-in object and will be directly referenced by the Windows Forms
application.</li>
 <li>CSharpSnapIn.dll: A snap-in written in C#, which leverages the types of
CommonSnappableTypes.dll.</li>
 <li>VbSnapIn.dll: A snap-in written in Visual Basic, which leverages the types of
CommonSnappableTypes.dll.</li>
 <li>MyExtendableApp.exe: This Windows Forms application will be the entity that may
be extended by the functionality of each snap-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this application will make use of dynamic loading, reflection, and late binding to dynamically
gain the functionality of assemblies it has no prior knowledge of.</p>
<h2>Building CommonSnappableTypes.dll</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to create an assembly that contains the types that a given snap-in must
leverage to be plugged into the expandable Windows Forms application. The CommonSnappableTypes
Class Library project defines two types:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> CommonSnappableTypes
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IAppFunctionality
    {
        <span class="kwrd">void</span> DoIt();
    }

    [AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class)]
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CompanyInfoAttribute : System.Attribute
    {
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> CompanyName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> CompanyUrl { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    }
}</pre>
<p>The IAppFunctionality interface provides a polymorphic interface for all snap-ins that can be
consumed by the extendable Windows Forms application. Given that this example is purely illustrative,
you supply a single method named DoIt(). A more realistic interface (or a set of interfaces) might allow
the object to generate scripting code, render an image onto the application’s toolbox, or integrate into
the main menu of the hosting application.</p>
<p>The CompanyInfoAttribute type is a custom attribute that can be applied on any class type that
wishes to be snapped into the container. As you can tell by the definition of this class, [CompanyInfo]
allows the developer of the snap-in to provide some basic details about the component’s point of origin.</p>
<h2>Building the C# Snap-In</h2>
<p>Next up, you need to create a type that implements the IAppFunctionality interface. Again, to focus on
the overall design of an extendable application, a trivial type is in order. Assume a new C# Class Library
project named CSharpSnapIn defines a class type named CSharpModule. Given that this class must make
use of the types defined in CommonSnappableTypes, be sure to set a reference to the
CommpnSnappableTypes assembly (as well as System.Windows.Forms.dll to display a noteworthy
message). This being said, here is the code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="kwrd">using</span> CommonSnappableTypes;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Windows.Forms;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> CSharpSnapIn
{
    [CompanyInfo(CompanyName = <span class="str">"My Company"</span>,
        CompanyUrl = <span class="str">"www.MyCompany.com"</span>)]
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CSharpModule : IAppFunctionality
    {
        <span class="kwrd">void</span> IAppFunctionality.DoIt()
        {
            MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"You have just used the C# snap in!"</span>);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that I choose to make use of explicit interface implementation (see Chapter 9) when
supporting the IAppFunctionality interface. This is not required; however, the idea is that the only part
of the system that needs to directly interact with this interface type is the hosting Windows application.
By explicitly implementing this interface, the DoIt() method is not directly exposed from the
CSharpModule type.</p>
<h2>Building the Visual Basic Snap-In</h2>
<p>Now, to simulate the role of a third-party vendor who prefers Visual Basic over C#, create a new Visual
Basic Class Library (VbSnapIn) that references the same external assemblies as the previous
CSharpSnapIn project.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> By default, a Visual Basic project will not display the References folder within the Solution Explorer. To add
references in a VB project, use the Project | Add Reference… menu option of Visual Studio 2010.</p>
<p>The code is (again) intentionally simple:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
Imports System.Windows.Forms
Imports CommonSnappableTypes

&lt;CompanyInfo(CompanyName:="Chucky's Software", CompanyUrl:="www.ChuckySoft.com")&gt;
Public Class VbSnapIn
	Implements IAppFunctionality

	Public Sub DoIt() Implements CommonSnappableTypes.IAppFunctionality.DoIt
		MessageBox.Show("You have just used the VB snap in!")
	End Sub
End Class
</pre>
<p>Notice that applying attributes in the syntax of Visual Basic requires angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) rather than
square brackets ([ ]). Also notice that the Implements keyword is used to implement interface types on a
given class or structure.</p>
<h2>Building an Extendable Windows Forms Application</h2>
<p>The final step is to create a new C# Windows Forms application (MyExtendableApp) that allows the user
to select a snap-in using a standard Windows Open dialog box. If you have not created a Windows Forms
application before, begin this final project of the chapter by selecting a Windows Forms Application
project from the New Project dialog box of Visual Studio 2010 (Figure 15-7).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure15_07.png" alt="Figure 15-7" />
<p><b>Figure 15-7</b> Creating a new Windows Forms project with Visual Studio 2010</p>
<p>Now, set a reference to the CommonSnappableTypes.dll assembly, but not the CSharpSnapIn.dll or
VbSnapIn.dll code libraries. As well, import the System.Reflection and CommonSnappableTypes
namespaces into your form’s primary code file (which you can open by right clicking on the form
designer and selecting View Code. Remember that the whole goal of this application is to make use of
late binding and reflection to determine the “snapability” of independent binaries created by third-party
vendors.</p>
<p>Again, I won’t bother to examine all the details of Windows Forms development at this point in the
text (see Appendix A). However, assuming you have placed a MenuStrip component onto the forms
designer, define a topmost menu item named File that provides a single submenu named Snap In
Module. As well, the main window will contain a ListBox type (which I renamed as lstLoadedSnapIns)
that will be used to display the names of each snap-in loaded by the user. Figure 15-8 shows the final
GUI.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure15_08.png" alt="Figure 15-8" />
<p><b>Figure 15-8</b> GUI for MyExtendableApp</p>
<p>The code that handles the Click event for the File &gt; Snap In Module menu item (which may be
created simply by double-clicking the menu item from the design-time editor) displays a File Open
dialog box and extracts the path to the selected file. Assuming the user did not select the
CommonSnappableTypes.dll assembly (as this is purely infrastructure), the path is then sent into a helper
function named LoadExternalModule() for processing (implemented next). This method will return
false when it is unable to find a class implementing IAppFunctionality:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> snapInModuleToolStripMenuItem_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender,
EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Allow user to select an assembly to load.</span>
    OpenFileDialog dlg = <span class="kwrd">new</span> OpenFileDialog();

    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (dlg.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span>(dlg.FileName.Contains(<span class="str">"CommonSnappableTypes"</span>))
            MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"CommonSnappableTypes has no snap-ins!"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">else</span> <span class="kwrd">if</span>(!LoadExternalModule(dlg.FileName))
            MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Nothing implements IAppFunctionality!"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>The LoadExternalModule() method performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Dynamically loads the selected assembly into memory</li>
 <li>Determines whether the assembly contains any types implementing
IAppFunctionality</li>
 <li>Creates the type using late binding</li>
</ul>
<p>If a type implementing IAppFunctionality is found, the DoIt() method is called, and the fully
qualified name of the type is added to the ListBox (note that the foreach loop will iterate over all types in
the assembly to account for the possibility that a single assembly has multiple snap-ins).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> LoadExternalModule(<span class="kwrd">string</span> path)
{
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> foundSnapIn = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;
    Assembly theSnapInAsm = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Dynamically load the selected assembly.</span>
        theSnapInAsm = Assembly.LoadFrom(path);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> foundSnapIn;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Get all IAppFunctionality compatible classes in assembly.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> theClassTypes = <span class="kwrd">from</span> t <span class="kwrd">in</span> theSnapInAsm.GetTypes()
        where t.IsClass &amp;&amp;
        (t.GetInterface(<span class="str">"IAppFunctionality"</span>) != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        select t;

    <span class="rem">// Now, create the object and call DoIt() method.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Type t <span class="kwrd">in</span> theClassTypes)
    {
        foundSnapIn = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
        <span class="rem">// Use late binding to create the type.</span>
        IAppFunctionality itfApp =
            (IAppFunctionality)theSnapInAsm.CreateInstance(t.FullName, <span class="kwrd">true</span>);
        itfApp.DoIt();
        lstLoadedSnapIns.Items.Add(t.FullName);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> foundSnapIn;
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you can run your application. When you select the CSharpSnapIn.dll or VbSnapIn.dll
assemblies, you should see the correct message displayed. The final task is to display the metadata
provided by the [CompanyInfo] attribute. To do so, update LoadExternalModule() to call a new helper
function named DisplayCompanyData() before exiting the foreach scope. Notice this method takes a
single System.Type parameter.</p>

        DisplayCompanyData(t);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> foundSnapIn;
}</pre>
<p>Using the incoming type, simply reflect over the [CompanyInfo] attribute:</p>

        (ci.GetType() == <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(CompanyInfoAttribute))
        select ci;

    <span class="rem">// Show data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (CompanyInfoAttribute c <span class="kwrd">in</span> compInfo)

            <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"More info about {0} can be found at"</span>, c.CompanyName));
    }
}</pre>

this chapter can be quite helpful in the real world and are not limited to the tool builders of the world.</p>
