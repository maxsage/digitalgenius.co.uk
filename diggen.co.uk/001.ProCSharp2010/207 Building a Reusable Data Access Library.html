<h1>Building a Reusable Data Access Library</h1>
<p>The ExecuteReader() method extracts a data reader object that allows you to examine the results of a
SQL Select statement using a forward-only, read-only flow of information. However, when you wish to
submit SQL statements that result in the modification of a given table (or any other non-query SQL
statement, such as creating tables or granting permissions), you call the ExecuteNonQuery() method of
your command object. This single method performs inserts, updates, and deletes based on the format of
your command text.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Technically speaking, a nonquery is a SQL statement that does not return a result set. Thus, Select
statements are queries, while Insert, Update, and Delete statements are not. Given this,
ExecuteNonQuery() returns an int that represents the number of rows affected, not a new set of records.</p>
<p>Next, you will learn how to modify an existing database using nothing more than a call to
ExecuteNonQuery(); your next goal is to build a custom data access library that can encapsulate the
process of operating upon the AutoLot database. In a production-level environment, your ADO.NET
logic will almost always be isolated to a .NET *.dll assembly for one simple reason: code reuse! The first
examples of this chapter have not done, simply so you can keep focused on the task at hand; however, it
would be a waste of time to author the same connection logic, the same data reading logic, and the same
command logic for every application that needs to interact with the AutoLot database.</p>
<p>Isolating data access logic to a .NET code library means that multiple applications using any sort of
front end (e.g., console-based, desktop-based, and web based) can reference the library at hand in a
language-independent manner. Thus, if you author your data library using C#, other .NET programmers
can build a UI in the language of their choice (e.g., VB or C++/CLI).</p>
<p>In this chapter, your data library (AutoLotDAL.dll) will contain a single namespace
(AutoLotConnectedLayer) that interacts with AutoLot using the connected types of ADO.NET. In the next
chapter, you will add a new namespace (AutoLotDisconnectionLayer) to this same *.dll that contains
types to communicate with AutoLot using the disconnected layer. Multiple applications will take
advantage of this library throughout the remainder of this book.</p>
<p>Begin by creating a new C# Class Library project named AutoLotDAL (short for AutoLot Data Access
Layer) and renaming your initial C# code file to AutoLotConnDAL.cs. Next, rename your namespace scope
to AutoLotConnectedLayer and change the name of your initial class to InventoryDAL; this class will define
various members to interact with the Inventory table of the AutoLot database. Finally, import the
following .NET namespaces:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="rem">// You will use the SQL server</span>
<span class="rem">// provider; however, it would also be</span>
<span class="rem">// permissible to use the ADO.NET</span>
<span class="rem">// factory pattern for greater flexibility.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Data;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Data.SqlClient;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> AutoLotConnectedLayer
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> InventoryDAL
    {
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> You might recall from Chapter 8 that when objects use types that manage raw resources (e.g., a database
connection), it is a good practice to implement IDisposable and author a proper finalizer. In a production
environment, classes such as InventoryDAL would do the same; however, you won’t do that here, so you can
stay focused on the particulars of ADO.NET.</p>
<h2>Adding the Connection Logic</h2>
<p>The first task you must attend to is to define some methods that allow the caller to connect to and
disconnect from the data source using a valid connection string. You will hard-code your AutoLotDAL.dll
assembly to use of the types of System.Data.SqlClient, so you need to define a private member variable
of SqlConnection that is allocated at the time the InventoryDAL object is created. Also, define a method
named OpenConnection() and another named CloseConnection() to interact with this member variable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> InventoryDAL
{
    <span class="rem">// This member will be used by all methods.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> SqlConnection = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OpenConnection(<span class="kwrd">string</span> connectionString)
    {
        sqlCn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlConnection();
        sqlCn.ConnectionString = connectionString;
        sqlCn.Open();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CloseConnection()
    {
        sqlCn.Close();
    }
}</pre>
<p>For the sake of brevity, your InventoryDAL type will not test for possible exceptions, nor will it throw
custom exceptions under various circumstances (e.g., a malformed connection string). If you were to
build an industrial-strength data access library, you would absolutely want to use structured exception
handling techniques to account for any runtime anomalies.</p>
<h2>Adding the Insertion Logic</h2>
<p>Inserting a new record into the Inventory table is as simple as formatting the SQL Insert statement
(based on user input) and calling the ExecuteNonQuery() using your command object. You can see this in
action by adding a public method to your InventoryDAL type named InsertAuto() that takes four
parameters that map to the four columns of the Inventory table (CarID, Color, Make, and PetName). You
use these arguments to format a string type to insert the new record. Finally, use your SqlConnection
object to execute the SQL statement:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> InsertAuto(<span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">string</span> color, <span class="kwrd">string</span> make, <span class="kwrd">string</span> petName)
{
    <span class="rem">// Format and execute SQL statement.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Insert Into Inventory"</span> +
        <span class="str">"(CarID, Make, Color, PetName) Values"</span> +
        <span class="str">"('{0}', '{1}', '{2}', '{3}')"</span>, id, make, color, petName);

    <span class="rem">// Execute using our connection.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
}</pre>
<p>This method is syntactically fine, but you could supply an overloaded version that allows the caller
to pass in a strongly typed class that represents the data for the new row. Define a new NewCar class,
which represents a new row in the Inventory table:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> NewCar
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> CarID { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Color { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Make { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>Now add the following version of InsertAuto() to your InventoryDAL class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> InsertAuto(NewCar car)
{
    <span class="rem">// Format and execute SQL statement.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Insert Into Inventory"</span> +
        <span class="str">"(CarID, Make, Color, PetName) Values"</span> +
        <span class="str">"('{0}', '{1}', '{2}', '{3}')"</span>, car.CarID, car.Make, car.Color, car.PetName);

    <span class="rem">// Execute using our connection.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Defining classes that represent records in a relational database is a common way to build a data
access library. In fact, as you will see in Chapter 23, the ADO.NET Entity Framework automatically
generates strongly typed classes that allow you to interact with database data. On a related note, the
disconnected layer of ADO.NET (see Chapter 22) generates strongly typed DataSet objects to represent
data from a given table in a relational database.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> As you might know, building a SQL statement using string concatenation can be risky from a security point
of view (think: SQL injection attacks). The preferred way to build command text is to use a parameterized query,
which you will learn about shortly.</p>
<h2>Adding the Deletion Logic</h2>
<p>Deleting an existing record is as simple as inserting a new record. Unlike when you created the code
listing for InsertAuto(), this time you will learn about an important try/catch scope that handles the
possibility of attempting to delete a car that is currently on order for an individual in the Customers table.
Add the following method to the InventoryDAL class type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DeleteCar(<span class="kwrd">int</span> id)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get ID of car to delete, then do so.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Delete from Inventory where CarID = '{0}'"</span>,
        id);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        <span class="kwrd">try</span>
        {
            cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
        <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(SqlException ex)
        {
            Exception error = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Exception(<span class="str">"Sorry! That car is on order!"</span>, ex);
                <span class="kwrd">throw</span> error;
        }
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Adding the Update Logic</h2>
<p>When it comes to the act of updating an existing record in the Inventory table, the first thing you must
decide is what you want to allow the caller to change, whether it’s the car’s color, the pet name, the
make, or all of the above. One way to give the caller complete flexibility is to define a method that takes a
string type to represent any sort of SQL statement, but that is risky at best.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to have a set of methods that allow the caller to update a record in a variety of
ways. However, for this simple data access library, you will define a single method that allows the caller
to update the pet name of a given automobile:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UpdateCarPetName(<span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">string</span> newPetName)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get ID of car to modify and new pet name.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Update Inventory Set PetName = '{0}' Where CarID = '{1}'"</span>,
        newPetName, id);

    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Adding the Selection Logic</h2>
<p>Next, you need to add a selection method. As you saw earlier in this chapter, a data provider’s data
reader object allows for a selection of records using a read-only, forward-only server-side cursor. As you
call the Read() method, you can process each record in a fitting manner. While this is all well and good,
you need to contend with the issue of how to return these records to the calling tier of your application.</p>
<p>One approach would be to populate and return a multidimensional array (or other such return
value, such as a generic List&lt;NewCar&gt; object) with the data obtained by the Read() method. Here is a
second way to obtain data from the Inventory table that uses the latter approach:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> List&lt;NewCar&gt; GetAllInventoryAsList()
{
    <span class="rem">// This will hold the records.</span>
    List&lt;NewCar&gt; inv = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;NewCar&gt;();

    <span class="rem">// Prep command object.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="str">"Select * From Inventory"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
        while (dr.Read())
        {
            inv.Add(<span class="kwrd">new</span> NewCar
            {
                CarID = (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)dr[<span class="str">"CarID"</span>],
                Color = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)dr[<span class="str">"Color"</span>],
                Make = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)dr[<span class="str">"Make"</span>],
                PetName = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)dr[<span class="str">"PetName"</span>]
            });
        }
        dr.Close();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> inv;
}</pre>
<p>Still another approach is to return a System.Data.DataTable object, which is actually part of the
disconnected layer of ADO.NET. You will find complete coverage of the disconnected layer in the next
chapter; however, for the time being, you should understand that a DataTable is a class type that
represents a tabular block of data (e.g., a grid on a spreadsheet).</p>
<p>Internally, the DataTable class represents data as a collection of rows and columns. While you can
fill these collections programmatically, the DataTable type provides a method named Load() that
automatically populates these collections using a data reader object! Consider the following methods,
which return data from Inventory as a DataTable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> DataTable GetAllInventoryAsDataTable()
{
    <span class="rem">// This will hold the records.</span>
    DataTable inv = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataTable();

    <span class="rem">// Prep command object.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="str">"Select * From Inventory"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
        <span class="rem">// Fill the DataTable with data from the reader and clean up.</span>
        inv.Load(dr);
        dr.Close();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> inv;
}</pre>
<h2>Working with Parameterized Command Objects</h2>
<p>Currently, the insert, update, and delete logic for the InventoryDAL type uses hard-coded string-literals
for each SQL query. As you might know, you can use a parameterized query to treat SQL parameters as
objects, rather than as a simple blob of text. Treating SQL queries in a more object-oriented manner
helps reduce the number of typos (given strongly typed properties); plus, parameterized queries
typically execute much faster than a literal SQL string because they are parsed exactly once (rather than
each time the SQL string is assigned to the CommandText property). Parameterized queries also help
protect against SQL injection attacks (a well-known data access security issue).</p>
<p>To support parameterized queries, ADO.NET command objects maintain a collection of individual
parameter objects. By default, this collection is empty, but you can insert any number of parameter
objects that map to a placeholder parameter in the SQL query. When you wish to associate a parameter
within a SQL query to a member in the command object’s parameters collection, you can prefix the SQL
text parameter with the @ symbol (at least when using Microsoft SQL Server; not all DBMSs support this
notation).</p>
<h2>Specifying Parameters Using the DbParameter Type</h2>
<p>Before you build a parameterized query, you need to familiarize yourself with the DbParameter type
(which is the base class to a provider’s specific parameter object). This class maintains a number of
properties that allow you to configure the name, size, and data type of the parameter, as well as other
characteristics, including the parameter’s direction of travel. Table 21-7 describes some key properties of
the DbParameter type.</p>
<p><b>Table 21-7.</b> Key Members of the DbParameter Type</p>
<table class="gridtable">
   <tr>
   <th>
    Property
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    DbType
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets the native data type of the parameter, represented as a CLR data type.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Direction
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets whether the parameter is input-only, output-only, bidirectional, or a
return value parameter.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    IsNullable
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets whether the parameter accepts null values.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ParameterName
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets the name of the DbParameter.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Size
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets the maximum parameter size of the data in bytes; this is only useful
for textual data.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Value
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets the value of the parameter.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Now let’s look at how to populate a command object’s collection of DBParameter-compatible objects
by reworking the following version of the InsertAuto() method to leverage parameter objects (you could
perform a similar reworking for your remaining methods; however, that’s not necessary for this
example):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> InsertAuto(<span class="kwrd">int</span> id, <span class="kwrd">string</span> color, <span class="kwrd">string</span> make, <span class="kwrd">string</span> petName)
{
    <span class="rem">// Note the "placeholders" in the SQL query.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> sql = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Insert Into Inventory"</span> +
        <span class="str">"(CarID, Make, Color, PetName) Values"</span> +
        <span class="str">"(@CarID, @Make, @Color, @PetName)"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// This command will have internal parameters.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(sql, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        <span class="rem">// Fill params collection.</span>
        SqlParameter param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
        param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@CarID"</span>;
        param.Value = id;
        param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Int;
        cmd.Parameters.Add(param);

        param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
        param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@Make"</span>;
        param.Value = make;
        param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Char;
        param.Size = 10;
        cmd.Parameters.Add(param);

        param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
        param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@Color"</span>;
        param.Value = color;
        param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Char;
        param.Size = 10;
        cmd.Parameters.Add(param);
        
        param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
        param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@PetName"</span>;
        param.Value = petName;
        param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Char;
        param.Size = 10;
        cmd.Parameters.Add(param);
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Again, notice that your SQL query consists of four embedded placeholder symbols, each of which is
prefixed with the @ token. You can use the SqlParameter type to map each placeholder using the
ParameterName property and specify various details (e.g., its value, data type, and size) in a strongly typed
matter. Once each parameter object is hydrated, it is added to the command object’s collection through
a call to Add().</p>
<p><b>Note</b> This example uses various properties to establish a parameter object. Note, however, that parameter
objects support a number of overloaded constructors that allow you to set the values of various properties (which
will result in a more compact code base). Also be aware that Visual Studio 2010 provides many graphical
designers that will generate a good deal of this grungy parameter-centric code on your behalf (see Chapters 22
and 23).</p>
<p>While building a parameterized query often requires more code, the end result is a more convenient
way to tweak SQL statements programmatically, as well as to achieve better overall performance. While
you are free to use this technique whenever a SQL query is involved, parameterized queries prove most
helpful when you wish to trigger a stored procedure.</p>
<h2>Executing a Stored Procedure</h2>
<p>Recall that a stored procedure is a named block of SQL code stored in the database. You can construct
stored procedures so they return a set of rows or scalar data types or do anything else that makes sense
(e.g., insert, update, or delete); you can also have them take any number of optional parameters. The end
result is a unit of work that behaves like a typical function, except that it is located on a data store rather
than a binary business object. Currently, your AutoLot database defines a single stored procedure named
GetPetName, which you formatted as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
GetPetName
@carID <span class="kwrd">int</span>,
@petName <span class="kwrd">char</span>(10) <span class="kwrd">output</span>
<span class="kwrd">AS</span>
<span class="kwrd">SELECT</span> @petName = PetName <span class="kwrd">from</span> Inventory <span class="kwrd">where</span> CarID = @carID</pre>
<p>Now consider the following final method of the InventoryDAL type, which invokes your stored
procedure:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> LookUpPetName(<span class="kwrd">int</span> carID)
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> carPetName = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Empty;
    
    <span class="rem">// Establish name of stored proc.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(<span class="str">"GetPetName"</span>, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn))
    {
        cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

        <span class="rem">// Input param.</span>
        SqlParameter param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
        param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@carID"</span>;
        param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Int;
        param.Value = carID;

        <span class="rem">// The default direction is in fact Input, but to be clear:</span>
        param.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;
        cmd.Parameters.Add(param);

        <span class="rem">// Output param.</span>
        param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
        param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@petName"</span>;
        param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Char;
        param.Size = 10;
        param.Direction = ParameterDirection.Output;
        cmd.Parameters.Add(param);
    
        <span class="rem">// Execute the stored proc.</span>
        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

        <span class="rem">// Return output param.</span>
        carPetName = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)cmd.Parameters[<span class="str">"@petName"</span>].Value;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> carPetName;
}</pre>
<p>One important aspect of invoking a stored procedure is to keep in mind that a command object can
represent a SQL statement (the default) or the name of a stored procedure. When you wish to inform a
command object that it will be invoking a stored procedure, you pass in the name of the procedure (as a
constructor argument or by using the CommandText property) and must set the CommandType property to
the value CommandType.StoredProcedure (if you fail to do this, you will receive a runtime exception
because the command object is expecting a SQL statement by default):</p>

SqlCommand cmd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(<span class="str">"GetPetName"</span>, <span class="kwrd">this</span>.sqlCn);
cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;</pre>
<p>Next, notice that the Direction property of a parameter object allows you to specify the direction of
travel for each parameter passed to the stored procedure (e.g., input parameter, output parameter,
in/out parameter, or return value). As before, you add each parameter object to the command object’s
parameters collection:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Input param.</span>
SqlParameter param = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlParameter();
param.ParameterName = <span class="str">"@carID"</span>;
param.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.Int;
param.Value = carID;
param.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;
cmd.Parameters.Add(param);</pre>
<p>After the stored procedure completes with a call to ExecuteNonQuery(), you can obtain the value of
the output parameter by investigating the command object’s parameter collection and casting
accordingly:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Return output param.</span>
carPetName = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)cmd.Parameters[<span class="str">"@petName"</span>].Value;</pre>
<p>At this point, your initial iteration of the AutoLotDAL.dll data access library is complete! You can use
this assembly to build any sort of front end to display and edit your data you want (e.g., console based,
Windows Forms based, Windows Presentation Foundation based, or an HTML-based web application).
You have not yet examined how to build graphical user interfaces, so next you will test your data library
from a new console application.</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> You can find the AutoLotDAL project under the Chapter 21 subdirectory.</p>
