<h1>Building the WCF Client Application</h1>
<p>Now that your host is in place, the final task is to build a piece of software to communicate with this
WCF service type. While you could take the long road and build the necessary infrastructure by hand (a
feasible, but labor-intensive task), the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK provides several approaches to generate
a client-side proxy quickly. Begin by creating a new Console Application named
MagicEightBallServiceClient.</p>  
<h2>Generating Proxy Code Using svcutil.exe</h2>  
<p>The first way you can build a client-side proxy is to use the svcutil.exe command-line tool. Using
svcutil.exe, you can generate a new C# language file that represents the proxy code itself, as well as a
client-side configuration file. You can do this by specifying the service’s endpoint as the first parameter.
You use the /out: flag to define the name of the *.cs file containing the proxy, and you use the /config:
option to specify the name of the generated client-side *.config file.</p>
<p>Assuming your service is currently running, the following command set passed into svcutil.exe will
generate two new files in the working directory (which should, of course, be entered as a single line
within a Visual Studio 2010 command prompt):</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
svcutil http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService
    /out:myProxy.cs /config:app.config
</pre>
<p>If you open the myProxy.cs file, you will find a client-side representation of the IEightBall interface,
as well as a new class named EightBallClient, which is the proxy class itself. This class derives from the
generic class, System.ServiceModel.ClientBase&lt;T&gt;, where T is the registered service interface.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of custom constructors, each method of the proxy (which is based on the
original interface methods) will be implemented to use the inherited Channel property to invoke the
correct service method. Here is a partial snapshot of the proxy type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
[System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute(<span class="str">"System.ServiceModel"</span>,
    <span class="str">"4.0.0.0"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> EightBallClient :
    System.ServiceModel.ClientBase&lt;IEightBall&gt;, IEightBall
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ObtainAnswerToQuestion(<span class="kwrd">string</span> userQuestion)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">base</span>.Channel.ObtainAnswerToQuestion(userQuestion);
    }
}</pre>
<p>When you create an instance of the proxy type in your client application, the base class will establish
a connection to the endpoint using the settings specified in the client-side application configuration file.
Much like the server-side configuration file, the generated client-side App.config file contains an
&lt;endpoint&gt; element and details about the basicHttpBinding used to communicate with the service.</p>
<p>You will also find the following &lt;client&gt; element, which (again) establishes the ABCs from the
client’s perspective:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">client</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">endpoint</span>
        <span class="attr">address</span><span class="kwrd">="http://localhost:8080/MagicEightBallService"</span>
        <span class="attr">binding</span><span class="kwrd">="basicHttpBinding"</span> <span class="attr">bindingConfiguration</span><span class="kwrd">="BasicHttpBinding_IEightBall"</span>
        <span class="attr">contract</span><span class="kwrd">="IEightBall"</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="BasicHttpBinding_IEightBall"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">client</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>At this point, you could include these two files into a client project (and reference the
System.ServiceModel.dll assembly), and then use the proxy type to communicate with the remote WCF
service. However, you’ll take a different approach here, looking at how Visual Studio can help you
further automate the creation of client-side proxy files.</p>
<h2>Generating Proxy Code Using Visual Studio 2010</h2>
<p>Like any good command-line tool, svcutil.exe provides a great number of options that you can use to
control how the client proxy is generated. If you do not require these advanced options, you can
generate the same two files using the Visual Studio 2010 IDE. For the client project, simply select the Add
Service Reference option from the Project menu.</p>
<p>Once you activate this menu option, you will be prompted to enter the service URI. At this point,
click the Go button to see the service description (see Figure 25-7).</p>

<p><b>Figure 25-7</b> Generating the proxy files using Visual Studio 2010</p>
<p>Beyond creating and inserting the proxy files into your current project, this tool is kind enough to
reference the WCF assemblies automatically on your behalf. In accordance with a naming convention,
the proxy class is defined within a namespace called ServiceReference, which is nested in the client’s
namespace (to avoid possible name clashes). Here is the complete client code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Location of the proxy.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> MagicEightBallServiceClient.ServiceReference1;
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MagicEightBallServiceClient
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Ask the Magic 8 Ball *****\n"</span>);

            <span class="kwrd">using</span> (EightBallClient ball = <span class="kwrd">new</span> EightBallClient())
            {
                Console.Write(<span class="str">"Your question: "</span>);
                <span class="kwrd">string</span> question = Console.ReadLine();
                <span class="kwrd">string</span> answer =
                    ball.ObtainAnswerToQuestion(question);
                Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"8-Ball says: {0}"</span>, answer);
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now assume your WCF console host is running, so you can execute the client. Here is one possible
response to a question I’ve been asking quite a bit during the authoring of this edition of the book (with
apologies to fine folks at Apress!)</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
***** Ask the Magic 8 Ball *****

Your question: Will I get this book done soon?
8-Ball says: No

Press any key to continue. . .</pre>
<p><b>Source Code</b> You can find the MagicEightBallServiceClient project located under the
MagicEightBallServiceHTTP directory of Chapter 25.</p>
<h2>Configuring a TCP-Based Binding</h2>
<p>At this point, the host and client applications are both configured to use the simplest of the HTTP-based
bindings, basicHttpBinding. Recall that the benefit of offloading settings to configuration files is that you
can change the underlying plumbing in a declarative manner and expose multiple bindings for the same
service.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, you can try a little experiment. Create a new folder on your C: drive (or wherever
you happen to be saving your code) named EightBallTCP; in this new folder, create two subdirectories
named Host and Client.</p>
<p>Next, use Windows Explorer to navigate to the \bin\Debug folder of the host project and copy
MagicEightBallServiceHost.exe, MagicEightBallServiceHost.exe.config, and
MagicEightBallServiceLib.dll to the C:\EightBallTCP\Host folder. Now use a simple text editor to open
the *.config file for editing and modify the existing contents as follows:</p>

                <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">host</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Essentially, this host’s *.config file strips out all the MEX settings (because you already built the
proxy) and establishes that it is using the netTcpBinding binding type through a unique port. Now run
the application by double-clicking the *.exe. If all is well, you should see the host output shown here:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
***** Console Based WCF Host *****

***** Host Info *****
Address: net.tcp://localhost:8090/MagicEightBallService
Binding: NetTcpBinding
Contract: IEightBall

**********************
The service is ready.
Press the Enter key to terminate service.

</pre>
<p>To complete the test, copy the MagicEightBallServiceClient.exe and
MagicEightBallServiceClient.exe.config files from the \bin\Debug folder of the client application into
the C:\EightBallTCP\Client folder. Update the client configuration file like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->

                <span class="attr">contract</span><span class="kwrd">="ServiceReference1.IEightBall"</span>
                <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="netTcpBinding_IEightBall"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>This client-side configuration file is a massive simplification compared to what the Visual Studio
proxy generator authored. Notice how you have completely removed the existing &lt;bindings&gt; element.
Originally, the *.config file contained a &lt;bindings&gt; element with a &lt;basicHttpBinding&gt; sub-element that
supplied numerous details of the client’s binding settings (e.g., timeouts).</p>
<p>The truth is you never needed that detail for this example because you automatically obtain the
default values of the underlying BasicHttpBinding object. If you needed to, you could of course update
the existing &lt;bindings&gt; element to define details of the &lt;netTcpBinding&gt; sub-element; however, doing so
is not required if you are happy with the default values of the NetTcpBinding object.</p>
<p>In any case, you should now be able to run your client application. Assuming the host is still running
in the background, you will be able to move data between your assemblies using TCP.</p>
