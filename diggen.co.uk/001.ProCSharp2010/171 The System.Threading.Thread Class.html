    <h1>The System.Threading.Thread Class</h1>
<p>The most primitive of all types in the System.Threading namespace is Thread. This class represents an
object-oriented wrapper around a given path of execution within a particular AppDomain. This type also
defines a number of methods (both static and instance level) that allow you to create new threads within
the current AppDomain, as well as to suspend, stop, and destroy a particular thread. Consider the list of
core static members in Table 19-2.</p>
<p><b>Table 19-2.</b> Key Static Members of the Thread Type</p>
<table class="gridtable">
   <tr>
   <th>

currently running.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>CurrentThread</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This read-only property returns a reference to the currently running
thread.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>GetDomain()

   </td>
   <td>
    <p>These methods return a reference to the current AppDomain or the
ID of this domain in which the current thread is running.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>

   <td>
    <p>Sleep()</p>
   </td>
   <td>
    <p>This method suspends the current thread for a specified time.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The Thread class also supports several instance-level members, some of which are shown in Table 19-3.</p>

    Abort()
   </td>
   <td>
    Instructs the CLR to terminate the thread as soon as possible.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Interrupt()
   </td>
   <td>
    Interrupts (e.g., wakes) the current thread from a suitable wait period.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Join()
   </td>
   <td>
    Blocks the calling thread until the specified thread (the one on which
Join() is called) exits.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Resume()
   </td>
   <td>
    Resumes a thread that has been previously suspended.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Start()
   </td>
   <td>
    Instructs the CLR to execute the thread ASAP.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Suspend()
   </td>
   <td>
    Suspends the thread. If the thread is already suspended, a call to
Suspend() has no effect.
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<p><b>Note</b> Aborting or suspending an active thread is generally considered a bad idea. When you do so, there is a
chance (however small) that a thread could “leak” its workload when disturbed or terminated.</p>
<h2>Obtaining Statistics About the Current Thread</h2>
<p>Recall that the entry point of an executable assembly (i.e., the Main() method) runs on the primary
thread of execution. To illustrate the basic use of the Thread type, assume you have a new Console
Application named ThreadStats. As you know, the static Thread.CurrentThread property retrieves a
Thread object that represents the currently executing thread. Once you have obtained the current thread,
you are able to print out various statistics:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Be sure to import the System.Threading namespace.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Primary Thread stats *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Obtain and name the current thread.</span>
    Thread primaryThread = Thread.CurrentThread;
    primaryThread.Name = <span class="str">"ThePrimaryThread"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Show details of hosting AppDomain/Context.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Name of current AppDomain: {0}"</span>,
        Thread.GetDomain().FriendlyName);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ID of current Context: {0}"</span>,
        Thread.CurrentContext.ContextID);
    
    <span class="rem">// Print out some stats about this thread.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Thread Name: {0}"</span>,
        primaryThread.Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Has thread started?: {0}"</span>,
        primaryThread.IsAlive);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Priority Level: {0}"</span>,
        primaryThread.Priority);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Thread State: {0}"</span>,
        primaryThread.ThreadState);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Primary Thread stats *****

Name of current AppDomain: ThreadStats.exe
ID of current Context: 0
Thread Name: ThePrimaryThread
Has thread started?: True
Priority Level: Normal
Thread State: Running</pre>
<h2>The Name Property</h2>
<p>While this code is more or less self-explanatory, do notice that the Thread class supports a property
called Name. If you do not set this value, Name will return an empty string. However, once you assign a
friendly string moniker to a given Thread object, you can greatly simplify your debugging endeavors. If
you are making use of Visual Studio 2010, you may access the Threads window during a debugging
session (select Debug &gt; Windows &gt; Threads). As you can see from Figure 19-1, you can quickly identify
the thread you wish to diagnose.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure19_01.png" alt="Figure 19-1" />
<p><b>Figure 19-1</b> </p>
<h2>The Priority Property</h2>
<p>Next, notice that the Thread type defines a property named Priority. By default, all threads have a
priority level of Normal. However, you can change this at any point in the thread’s lifetime using the
ThreadPriority property and the related System.Threading.ThreadPriority enumeration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> ThreadPriority
{
    Lowest,
    BelowNormal,
    Normal, <span class="rem">// Default value.</span>
    AboveNormal,
    Highest
}</pre>
<p>If you were to assign a thread’s priority level to a value other than the default
(ThreadPriority.Normal), understand that you would have no direct control over when the thread
scheduler switches between threads. In reality, a thread’s priority level offers a hint to the CLR regarding
the importance of the thread’s activity. Thus, a thread with the value ThreadPriority.Highest is not
necessarily guaranteed to be given the highest precedence.</p>
<p>Again, if the thread scheduler is preoccupied with a given task (e.g., synchronizing an object,
switching threads, or moving threads), the priority level will most likely be altered accordingly. However,
all things being equal, the CLR will read these values and instruct the thread scheduler how to best
allocate time slices. Threads with an identical thread priority should each receive the same amount of
time to perform their work.</p>
<p>In most cases, you will seldom (if ever) need to directly alter a thread’s priority level. In theory, it is
possible to jack up the priority level on a set of threads, thereby preventing lower-priority threads from
executing at their required levels (so use caution).</p>
