<h1>Interacting with the Incoming HTTP Request</h1>
<p>As you saw earlier in this chapter, the basic flow of a web application begins with a client requesting
a web page, possibly filling in user information, and clicking a “Submit button” to post back the
HTML form data to a given web page for processing. In most cases, the opening tag of the form
statement specifies an action attribute and a method attribute that indicates the file on the web
server that will be sent the data in the various HTML widgets, as well as the method of sending this
data (GET or POST):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">form</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="defaultPage"</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="defaultPage"</span>
    <span class="attr">action</span><span class="kwrd">="http://localhost/Cars/ClassicAspPage.asp"</span> <span class="attr">method</span> = <span class="kwrd">"GET"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
...
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">form</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>All ASP.NET pages support the System.Web.UI.Page.Request property, which provides access to an
instance of the HttpRequest class type (see Table 32-5 for some common members of this class).</p>

<p>In addition to these properties, the HttpRequest type has a number of useful methods, including the
following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>MapPath(): Maps the virtual path in the requested URL to a physical path on the
server for the current request</li>
 <li>SaveAs(): Saves details of the current HTTP request to a file on the web server,
which can prove helpful for debugging purposes.</li>
 <li>ValidateInput(): If the validation feature is enabled via the Validate attribute of
the page directive, this method can be called to check all user input data
(including cookie data) against a predefined list of potentially dangerous input
data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Obtaining Brower Statistics</h2>
<p>The first interesting aspect of the HttpRequest type is the Browser property, which provides access to an
underlying HttpBrowserCapabilities object. HttpBrowserCapabilities, in turn, exposes numerous
members that allow you to programmatically investigate statistics regarding the browser that sent the
incoming HTTP request.</p>
<p>Create a new ASP.NET website named FunWithPageMembers (again, elect to use the File System
option). Your first task is to build a UI that allows users to click a Button web control (named
btnGetBrowserStats) to view various statistics about the calling browser. These statistics will be
generated dynamically and attached to a Label type (named lblOutput). The button’s Click event
handler is as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetBrowserStats_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> theInfo = <span class="str">""</span>;
    theInfo += <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Is the client AOL? {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        Request.Browser.AOL);
    theInfo += <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Does the client support ActiveX? {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        Request.Browser.ActiveXControls);
    theInfo += <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Is the client a Beta? {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        Request.Browser.Beta);
    theInfo += <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Does the client support Java Applets? {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        Request.Browser.JavaApplets);
    theInfo += <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Does the client support Cookies? {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        Request.Browser.Cookies);
    theInfo += <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Does the client support VBScript? {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        Request.Browser.VBScript);
    lblOutput.Text = theInfo;
}</pre>
<p>Here you are testing for a number of browser capabilities. As you would guess, it is (very) helpful to
discover a browser’s support for ActiveX controls, Java applets, and client-side VBScript code. If the
calling browser does not support a given web technology, your *.aspx page will be able to take an
alternative course of action.</p>
<h2>Access to Incoming Form Data</h2>
<p>Other aspects of the HttpResponse type are the Form and QueryString properties. These two properties
allow you to examine the incoming form data using name/value pairs. While you could make use of the
HttpRequest.Form and HttpRequest.QueryString properties to access client-supplied form data on the
web server, ASP.NET provides a more elegant, object-oriented approach. Given that ASP.NET supplies
you with server-side web controls, you are able to treat HTML UI elements as true objects. Therefore,
rather than obtaining the value within a text box as follows</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetFormData_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get value for a widget with ID txtFirstName.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> firstName = Request.Form(<span class="str">"txtFirstName"</span>);
    <span class="rem">// Use this value in your page...</span>
}</pre>
    <p>you can simply ask the server-side widget directly via the Text property for use in your program, like so</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnGetFormData_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get value for a widget with ID txtFirstName.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> firstName = txtFirstName.Text;
    
    <span class="rem">// Use this value in your page...</span>
}</pre>
    <p>Not only does this approach lend itself to solid OO principles, but also you do not need to concern
yourself with how the form data was submitted (GET or POST) before obtaining the values. Furthermore,
working with the widget directly is much more type-safe, given that typing errors are discovered at
compile time rather than runtime. Of course, this is not to say that you will never need to make use of the
Form or QueryString property in ASP.NET; rather, the need to do so has greatly diminished and is usually
optional.</p>
<h2>The IsPostBack Property</h2>
<p>Another very important member of HttpRequest is the IsPostBack property. Recall that “postback” refers
to a web page posting back to the same URL at the Web server. Given this definition, understand that the
IsPostBack property will return true if the current HTTP request has been sent by a user currently in
session, and false if this is the user’s first interaction with the page.</p>
<p>Typically, the need to determine whether the current HTTP request is indeed a postback is most
helpful when you wish to execute a block of code only the first time the user accesses a given page. For
example, you may wish to populate an ADO.NET DataSet when the user first accesses an *.aspx file and
cache the object for later use. When the caller returns to the page, you can avoid the need to hit the
database unnecessarily (of course, some pages may require that the DataSet always be updated upon
each request, but that is another issue). Assuming your *.aspx file has handled the page’s Load event
(described in detail later in this chapter), you could programmatically test for postback conditions as
follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Fill DataSet only the very first time</span>
    <span class="rem">// the user comes to this page.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (!IsPostBack)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Populate DataSet and cache it!</span>
    }
    <span class="rem">// Use cached DataSet.</span>
}</pre>
    </body>
    </html>
