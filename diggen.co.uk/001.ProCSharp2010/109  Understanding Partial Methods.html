<h1>Understanding Partial Methods</h1>
  <p>Since the release of .NET 2.0, it has been possible to build partial class definitions using the partial
keyword (see Chapter 5). Recall that this bit of syntax allows you to partition the full implementation of a
type across multiple code files (or other locations, such as in memory). As long as each aspect of the
partial type has the same fully qualified name, the end result is a single “normal” compiled class type in
the assembly being constructed.</p>
<p>C# recycles the role of the partial keyword in that it can now be applied on the method level. In a
nutshell, this allows you to prototype a method in one file, yet implement it in another file. If you have a
C++ background, this might remind you of a C++ header/implementation file; however, C# partial
methods have a number of important restrictions:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Partial methods can only be defined within a partial class.</li>
 <li>Partial methods must return void.</li>
 <li>Partial methods can be static or instance level.</li>
 <li>Partial methods can have arguments (including parameters modified by this, ref,
or params—but not with the out modifier).</li>
 <li>Partial methods are always implicitly private.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even stranger is the fact that a partial method may or may not be emitted into the compiled
assembly! Let’s see an example to clarify matters.</p>
<h2>A First Look at Partial Methods</h2>
  <p>To see the implications of defining a partial method, create a new Console Application project named
PartialMethods. Now, define a new class named CarLocator within a C# file named CarLocator.cs:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// CarLocator.cs</span>
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarLocator
{
    <span class="rem">// This member will always be part of the</span>
    <span class="rem">// CarLocator class.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> CarAvailableInZipCode(<span class="kwrd">string</span> zipCode)
    {
        <span class="rem">// This call *may* be part of this method</span>
        <span class="rem">// implementation.</span>
        VerifyDuplicates(zipCode);

        <span class="rem">// Assume some interesting database logic</span>
        <span class="rem">// here...</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    }

    <span class="rem">// This member *may* be part of the CarLocator class!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> VerifyDuplicates(<span class="kwrd">string</span> make);
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the VerifyDuplicates() method has been defined with the partial modifier and does
not define a method body within this file. Also notice that the CarAvailableInZipCode() method is
making a call to VerifyDuplicates() within its implementation.</p>
<p>If you were to compile this application as it now stands and open the compiled assembly in a tool
such as ildasm.exe or reflector.exe, you would find no trace of the VerifyDuplicates() method in the
CarLocator class, and no trace of the call to VerifyDuplicates() within CarAvailableInZipCode()! With
the project as it now stands, you really authored the following definition of the CarLocator class as far as
the compiler is concerned:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">internal</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarLocator
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> CarAvailableInZipCode(<span class="kwrd">string</span> zipCode)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    }
}</pre>
<p>The reason for this strange stripping away of code has to do with the fact that the partial
VerifyDuplicates() method was never given a true implementation. If you were to now add a new file to
your project (named perhaps CarLocatorImpl.cs) that defined the remainder of the partial method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// CarLocatorImpl.cs</span>
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarLocator
{
    <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> VerifyDuplicates(<span class="kwrd">string</span> make)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Assume some expensive data validation</span>
        <span class="rem">// takes place here...</span>
    }
}</pre>
<p>you would find that the full scope of the CarLocator class is taken into account at compile time, as shown
in the following approximate C# code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">internal</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarLocator
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> CarAvailableInZipCode(<span class="kwrd">string</span> zipCode)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.VerifyDuplicates(zipCode);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> VerifyDuplicates(<span class="kwrd">string</span> make)
    {
    }
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, when a method is defined with the partial keyword, the compiler will determine if it
should be emitted into the assembly based on whether the method has a method body or is simply an
empty signature. If there is no method body, all traces of the method (invocations, metadata
descriptions, prototypes) are stripped out during the compilation cycle.</p>
<p>In some ways, C# partial methods are a strongly typed version of conditional code compilation (via
the #if, #elif, #else, and #endif preprocessor directives). The major difference, however, is that a
partial method will be completely ignored during the compilation cycle (regardless of build settings) if
there is not a supporting implementation.</p>
<h2>Uses of Partial Methods</h2>
<p>Given the restrictions that come with partial methods, most notably that they must be implicitly private
and always return void, it is hard to see many useful applications of this new language feature. Truth be
told, out of all of the language features of C#, partial methods seem among those likely to be used the
least.</p>
<p>In the current example, the VerifyDuplicates() method was marked as partial for illustrative
purposes. However, imagine that this method, if implemented, had to perform some very intensive
calculations.</p>
<p>By marking this method with the partial modifier, other class builders have the option of providing
implementation details if they so choose. In this case, partial methods provide a cleaner solution than
using preprocessor directives, supplying “dummy” implementations to virtual methods, or throwing
NotImplementedException objects.</p>
<p>The most common use of this syntax is to define what are termed lightweight events. This technique
enables class designers to provide method hooks, similar to event handlers, that developers may choose
to implement or not. As a naming convention, such lightweight event-handling methods take an On
prefix, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// CarLocator.EventHandler.cs</span>
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarLocator
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> CarAvailableInZipCode(<span class="kwrd">string</span> zipCode)
    {
        ...
        OnZipCodeLookup(zipCode);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    }
    ...

    <span class="rem">// A "lightweight" event handler.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnZipCodeLookup(<span class="kwrd">string</span> make);
}</pre>
<p>If any class builders wish to be informed when the CarAvailableInZipCode() method has been
called, they can provide an implementation of the OnZipCodeLookup() method. If they do not care, they
simply do nothing.</p>
