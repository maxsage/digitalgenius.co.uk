<h1>Binding DataTable Objects to Windows Forms GUIs</h1>
<p>So far, you have examined how to create, hydrate, and iterate over the contents of a DataSet object
manually using the inherit object model of ADO.NET. While understanding how to do so is quite
important, the .NET platform ships with numerous APIs that have the ability to bind data to user
interface elements automatically.</p>    
<p>For example, the original GUI toolkit of .NET, Windows Forms, supplies a control named
DataGridView that includes the built-in ability to display the contents of a DataSet or DataTable object
using only a few lines of code. ASP.NET (.NET’s web development API) and the Windows Presentation
Foundation API (a supercharged GUI API introduced with .NET 3.0) also support the notion of data
binding. You will learn to bind data to WPF and ASP.NET GUI elements later in this book; however, in
this chapter, you will use Windows Forms because it is a fairly simple and straightforward programming
model.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The next example assumes you have some experience using Windows Forms to build graphical user
interfaces. If this is not the case, you might wish to open the solution and follow along or return to this section
once you have read Appendix A.</p>
<p>Your next task is to build a Windows Forms application that will display the contents of a DataTable
object within its user interface. Along the way, you will also examine how to filter and change table data.
You will also learn about the role of the DataView object.</p>
<p>Begin by creating a brand-new Windows Forms project workspace named
WindowsFormsDataBinding. Rename your initial Form1.cs file to the more fitting MainForm.cs using the
Solution Explorer. Next, use the Visual Studio 2010 Toolbox to drag a DataGridView control (renamed to
carInventoryGridView using the (Name) property of the Properties window) onto the designer surface.
Notice that when you do this, you activate a context menu that allows you to connect to a physical data
source. For the time being, ignore this aspect of the designer because you will be binding your DataTable
object programmatically. Finally, add a descriptive Label to your designer for information purposes.
Figure 22-5 shows one possible look-and-feel.</p>

<h2>Hydrating a DataTable from a Generic List&lt;T&gt;</h2>
<p>Similar to the previous SimpleDataSet example, the WindowsFormsDataBinding application will
construct a DataTable that contains a set of DataColumns representing various columns and rows of data.
This time, however, you will fill the rows using a generic List&lt;T&gt; member variable. First, insert a new C#
class into your project (named Car), which you define as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> ID { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Make { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Color { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>Within the default constructor of your main form, populate a List&lt;T&gt; member variable (named
listCars) with a set of new Car objects:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    <span class="rem">// A collection of Car objects.</span>
    List&lt;Car&gt; listCars = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MainForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        <span class="rem">// Fill the list with some cars.</span>
        listCars = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;Car&gt;
        {
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 100, PetName = <span class="str">"Chucky"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"BMW"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Green"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 101, PetName = <span class="str">"Tiny"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"White"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 102, PetName = <span class="str">"Ami"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Jeep"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Tan"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 103, PetName = <span class="str">"Pain Inducer"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Caravan"</span>,
                Color = <span class="str">"Pink"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 104, PetName = <span class="str">"Fred"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"BMW"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Green"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 105, PetName = <span class="str">"Sidd"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"BMW"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Black"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 106, PetName = <span class="str">"Mel"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Firebird"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Red"</span> },
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car { ID = 107, PetName = <span class="str">"Sarah"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Colt"</span>, Color = <span class="str">"Black"</span> },
        };
    }
}</pre>
<p>Next, add a new member variable named inventoryTable of type DataTable to your MainForm class
type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    <span class="rem">// A collection of Car objects.</span>
    List&lt;Car&gt; listCars = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Inventory information</span>
    DataTable inventoryTable = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataTable();
...
}</pre>
<p>Now add a new helper function to your class named CreateDataTable() and call this method within
the default constructor of the MainForm class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CreateDataTable()
{
        <span class="rem">// Create table schema.</span>
    DataColumn carIDColumn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataColumn(<span class="str">"ID"</span>, <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span>));
    DataColumn carMakeColumn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataColumn(<span class="str">"Make"</span>, <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>));
    DataColumn carColorColumn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataColumn(<span class="str">"Color"</span>, <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>));
    DataColumn carPetNameColumn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataColumn(<span class="str">"PetName"</span>, <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>));
    carPetNameColumn.Caption = <span class="str">"Pet Name"</span>;
    inventoryTable.Columns.AddRange(<span class="kwrd">new</span> DataColumn[] { carIDColumn,
        carMakeColumn, carColorColumn, carPetNameColumn });
    
    <span class="rem">// Iterate over the List&lt;T&gt; to make rows.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> listCars)
    {
        DataRow newRow = inventoryTable.NewRow();
        newRow[<span class="str">"ID"</span>] = c.ID;
        newRow[<span class="str">"Make"</span>] = c.Make;
        newRow[<span class="str">"Color"</span>] = c.Color;
        newRow[<span class="str">"PetName"</span>] = c.PetName;
        inventoryTable.Rows.Add(newRow);
    }
    
    <span class="rem">// Bind the DataTable to the carInventoryGridView.</span>
    carInventoryGridView.DataSource = inventoryTable;
}</pre>
<p>The method implementation begins by creating the schema of the DataTable by creating four
DataColumn objects (for the sake of simplicity, you don’t need to bother autoincrementing the ID field or
set it as a primary key). After you do this, you can add them to the column collection of the DataTable
member variable. You map the row data from your List&lt;Car&gt; collection into the DataTable using a
foreach iteration construct and the native ADO.NET object model.</p>
<p>However, notice that the final code statement within the CreateDataTable() method assigns the
inventoryTable to the DataSource property of the DataGridView object. This single property is all you
need to set to bind a DataTable to a Windows Forms DataGridView object. Under the hood, this GUI
control reads the row and column collections internally, much like what happens with the
PrintDataSet() method of the SimpleDataSet example. At this point, you should be able to run your
application and see the DataTable within the DataGridView control, as shown in Figure 22-6.</p>

<p><b>Figure 22-6</b> Binding a DataTable to a Windows Forms DataGridView</p>
<h2>Deleting Rows from a DataTable</h2>
<p>Now, assume you wish to update your graphical interface to allow the user to delete a row from the inmemory
DataTable that is bound to the DataGridView. One approach is to call the Delete() method of the
DataRow object that represents the row to terminate. In this case, you specify the index (or DataRow
object) representing the row to remove. To allow the user to specify which row to delete, add a TextBox
(named txtCarToRemove) and a Button control (named btnRemoveCar) to the current designer. Figure 22-7
shows one possible UI update (note this example wraps the two controls in a GroupBox control,
illustrating how they are related).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure22_07.png" alt="Figure 22-7" />
<p><b>Figure 22-7</b> Updating the UI to enable removal of rows from the underlying DataTable</p>
<p>The following logic behind the new Button’s Click event handler removes the user-specified row,
based on the ID of a car, from your in-memory DataTable. The Select() method of the DataTable class
allows you to specify a search criteria, which is modeled after normal SQL syntax. The return value is an
array of DataRow objects that matches the search criteria:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Remove this row from the DataRowCollection.</span>
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnRemoveCar_Click (<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Find the correct row to delete.</span>
        DataRow[] rowToDelete = inventoryTable.Select(
            <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"ID={0}"</span>, <span class="kwrd">int</span>.Parse(txtCarToRemove.Text)));

        <span class="rem">// Delete it!</span>
        rowToDelete[0].Delete();
        inventoryTable.AcceptChanges();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>You should now be able to run your application and specify a car ID to delete from the DataTable. As
you remove DataRow objects from the DataTable, you will notice that the grid’s UI is updated
immediately; this occurs because it is bound to the state of the DataTable object.</p>
<h2>Selecting Rows Based on Filter Criteria</h2>
<p>Many data-centric applications require the need to view a small subset of a DataTable’s data, as specified
by some sort of filtering criteria. For example, assume you wish to see only a certain make of automobile
from the in-memory DataTable (e.g., only BMWs). You’ve already seen how the Select() method of the
DataTable class allows you to find a row to delete; however you can also use this method to grab a subset
of records for display purposes.</p>
<p>To see this in action, update your UI again, this time allowing users to specify a string that
represents the make of the automobile they want to see (see Figure 22-8) using a new TextBox (named
txtMakeToView) and a new Button (named btnDisplayMakes).</p>

<p><b>Figure 22-8</b> Updating the UI to enable row filtering</p>
<p>The Select() method has been overloaded a number of times to provide different selection
semantics. At its most basic level, the parameter sent to Select() is a string that contains some
conditional operation. To begin, observe the following logic for the Click event handler of your new
button:The Select() method has been overloaded a number of times to provide different selection

    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> strMake = <span class="str">""</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; makes.Length; i++)
        {
            <span class="rem">// From the current row, get the PetName value.</span>
            strMake += makes[i][<span class="str">"PetName"</span>] + <span class="str">"\n"</span>;
        }
    
        <span class="rem">// Show the names of call cars matching the specified Make.</span>
        MessageBox.Show(strMake,
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"We have {0}s named:"</span>, txtMakeToView.Text));
    }
}</pre>
<p>Here, you begin by building a simple filter based on the value in the associated TextBox. If you
specify BMW, your filter looks like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Make = <span class="str">'BMW'</span></pre>
<p>When you send this filter to the Select() method, you get back an array of DataRow types that
represent each row that matches the filter (see Figure 22-9).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure22_09.png" alt="Figure 22-9" />
<p><b>Figure 22-9</b> Displaying filtered data</p>
<p>Again, the filtering logic is based on standard SQL syntax. For example, assume you wish to obtain
the results of the previous Select() invocation alphabetically, based on the pet name. In terms of SQL,
this translates into a sort based on the PetName column. Fortunately, the Select() method has been
overloaded to send in a sort criterion:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Sort by PetName.</span>
makes = inventoryTable.Select(filterStr, <span class="str">"PetName"</span>);</pre>
<p>Call Select() as seen here if you want the results in descending order:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Return results in descending order.</span>
makes = inventoryTable.Select(filterStr, <span class="str">"PetName DESC"</span>);</pre>
    <p>In general, the sort string contains the column name, followed by ASC (ascending, which is the
default) or DESC (descending). If necessary, you can separate multiple columns by commas. Finally,
understand that a filter string can be composed of any number of relational operators. For example,
assume you want to find all cars with an ID greater than 5. This helper function lets you accomplish that:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ShowCarsWithIdGreaterThanFive()
{
    <span class="rem">// Now show the pet names of all cars with ID greater than 5.</span>
    DataRow[] properIDs;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> newFilterStr = <span class="str">"ID &gt; 5"</span>;
    properIDs = inventoryTable.Select(newFilterStr);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> strIDs = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">for</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; properIDs.Length; i++)
    {
        DataRow temp = properIDs[i];
        strIDs += temp[<span class="str">"PetName"</span>]
            + <span class="str">" is ID "</span> + temp[<span class="str">"ID"</span>] + <span class="str">"\n"</span>;
    }
    MessageBox.Show(strIDs, <span class="str">"Pet names of cars where ID &gt; 5"</span>);
}</pre>
<h2>Updating Rows Within a DataTable</h2>
<p>The final aspect of the DataTable you should be aware of is the process of updating an existing row with
new values. One approach is to first obtain the row(s) that match a given filter criterion using the
Select() method. Once you obtain the DataRow(s) in question, modify them accordingly. For example,
assume you have a new Button on your form named btnChangeMakes that (when clicked) searches the
DataTable for all rows where Make is equal to BMW. Once you identify these items, you change the Make
from BMW to Yugo:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Find the rows you want to edit with a filter.</span>
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnChangeMakes_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Confirm selection.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (DialogResult.Yes ==
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Are you sure?? BMWs are much nicer than Yugos!"</span>,
            <span class="str">"Please Confirm!"</span>, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo))
    {
        <span class="rem">// Build a filter.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> filterStr = <span class="str">"Make='BMW'"</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> strMake = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Empty;

        <span class="rem">// Find all rows matching the filter.</span>
        DataRow[] makes = inventoryTable.Select(filterStr);

        <span class="rem">// Change all Beemers to Yugos!</span>
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; makes.Length; i++)
        {
            makes[i][<span class="str">"Make"</span>] = <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>;
    }
}
}</pre>
<h2>Working with the DataView Type</h2>
<p>A view object is an alternative representation of a table (or set of tables). For example, you can use
Microsoft SQL Server to create a view for your Inventory table that returns a new table containing
automobiles only of a given color. In ADO.NET, the DataView type allows you to extract a subset of data
programmatically from the DataTable into a stand-alone object.</p>
<p>One great advantage of holding multiple views of the same table is that you can bind these views to
various GUI widgets (such as the DataGridView). For example, one DataGridView might be bound to a
DataView showing all autos in the Inventory, while another might be configured to display only green
automobiles.</p>
<p>To see this in action, update the current UI with an additional DataGridView type named
dataGridYugosView and a descriptive Label. Next, define a member variable named yugosOnlyView of
type DataView:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    <span class="rem">// View of the DataTable.</span>
    DataView yugosOnlyView;
...
}</pre>
<p>Now create a new helper function named CreateDataView() and call this method within the form’s
default constructor immediately after the DataTable has been fully constructed, as shown here:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> MainForm()
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Make a data table.</span>
    CreateDataTable();

    <span class="rem">// Make a view.</span>
    CreateDataView();
}</pre>
<p>Here is the implementation of this new helper function. Notice that the constructor of each
DataView has been passed the DataTable that you will use to build the custom set of data rows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CreateDataView()
{
    <span class="rem">// Set the table that is used to construct this view.</span>
    yugosOnlyView = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataView(inventoryTable);

    <span class="rem">// Now configure the views using a filter.</span>
    yugosOnlyView.RowFilter = <span class="str">"Make = 'Yugo'"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Bind to the new grid.</span>
    dataGridYugosView.DataSource = yugosOnlyView;
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, the DataView class supports a property named RowFilter, which contains the string
representing the filtering criteria used to extract matching rows. Once you establish your view, set the
grid’s DataSource property accordingly. Figure 22-10 shows the completed Windows Forms data-binding
application in action.</p>
