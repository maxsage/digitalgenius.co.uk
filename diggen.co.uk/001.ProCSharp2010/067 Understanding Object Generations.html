<h1>Understanding Object Generations</h1>
 <p>When the CLR is attempting to locate unreachable objects, is does not literally examine each and every
object placed on the managed heap. Doing so, obviously, would involve considerable time, especially in
larger (i.e., real-world) applications.</p>
<p>To help optimize the process, each object on the heap is assigned to a specific “generation.” The
idea behind generations is simple: the longer an object has existed on the heap, the more likely it is to
stay there. For example, the class that defined the main window of a desktop application will be in
memory until the program terminates. Conversely, objects that have only recently been placed on the
heap (such as an object allocated within a method scope) are likely to be unreachable rather quickly.
Given these assumptions, each object on the heap belongs to one of the following generations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Generation 0:</i> Identifies a newly allocated object that has never been marked for
        collection.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Generation 1:</i> Identifies an object that has survived a garbage collection (i.e., it was
        marked for collection but was not removed due to the fact that the sufficient heap
        space was acquired).
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Generation 2:</i> Identifies an object that has survived more than one sweep of the
garbage collector.
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Generations 0 and 1 are termed ephemeral generations. As explained in the next section, you will see that
the garbage collection process does treat ephemeral generations differently.</p>
<p> 
The garbage collector will investigate all generation 0 objects first. If marking and sweeping (or said
more plainly, getting rid of) these objects results in the required amount of free memory, any surviving
objects are promoted to generation 1. To see how an object’s generation affects the collection process,
ponder Figure 8-5, which diagrams how a set of surviving generation 0 objects (A, B, and E) are
promoted once the required memory has been reclaimed.
</p>
<p><b>Figure 8-5.</b> Generation 0 objects that survive a garbage collection are promoted to generation 1</p>
<p>If all generation 0 objects have been evaluated, but additional memory is still required, generation 1
objects are then investigated for reachability and collected accordingly. Surviving generation 1 objects
are then promoted to generation 2. If the garbage collector still requires additional memory, generation
2 objects are evaluated. At this point, if a generation 2 object survives a garbage collection, it remains a
generation 2 object given the predefined upper limit of object generations.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that by assigning a generational value to objects on the heap, newer objects (such
as local variables) will be removed quickly, while older objects (such as a program’s application object)
are not "bothered" as often.</p>
