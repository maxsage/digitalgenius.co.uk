<h1>Investigating the Core WCF Assemblies</h1>
   <p>As you might expect, the programming fabric of WCF is represented by a set of .NET assemblies installed
into the GAC. Table 25-1 describes the overall role of the core WCF assemblies you need to use in just
about any WCF application.</p>
<p><b>Table 25-1.</b> Core WCF Assemblies</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Assembly
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.Runtime.Serialization.dll
   </td>
   <td>
    Defines namespaces and types that you can use for serializing
and deserializing objects in the WCF framework.
   </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
   <td>
    System.ServiceModel.dll
   </td>
   <td>
    This core assembly contains the types used to build any sort of
WCF application.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These two assemblies define many new namespaces and types. You should consult the .NET
Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for complete details; however, Table 25-2 documents the roles of
some of the important namespaces.</p>

   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.Runtime.Serialization
   </td>
   <td>
    Defines many types you use to control how data is
serialized and deserialized within the WCF framework.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.ServiceModel
   </td>
   <td>
    This primary WCF namespace defines binding and hosting
types, as well as basic security and transactional types.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.ServiceModel.Configuration
   </td>
   <td>
    Defines numerous types that provide programmatic access
to WCF configuration files.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.ServiceModel.Description
   </td>
   <td>
    Defines types that provide an object model to the
addresses, bindings, and contracts defined within WCF
configuration files.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration
   </td>
   <td>
    Contains types to integrate with the MSMQ service.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    System.ServiceModel.Securit
   </td>
   <td>
    Defines numerous types to control aspects of the WCF
security layers.
   </td>
  </tr>

<h2>A Brief Word Regarding CardSpace</h2>
<p>In addition to System.ServiceModel.dll and System.Runtime.Serialization.dll, WCF
provides a third assembly named System.IdentityModel.dll. This assembly contains many
additional namespaces and types that support the CardSpace API. This technology allows you to establish
and manage digital identities within a WCF application. Essentially, the CardSpace API provides a unified
programming model to account for various security-related details for WCF applications, such as caller
identity, user authentication/authorization services, and so on.</p>
<p>You will not examine CardSpace further in this edition of the book, so be sure to consult the .NET
Framework 4.0 SDK documentation if you want to learn more.</p>
