<h1>Understanding Publisher Policy Assemblies</h1>
    <p>The next configuration issue we’ll examine is the role of publisher policy assemblies. As you’ve just seen,
*.config files can be constructed to bind to a specific version of a shared assembly, thereby bypassing
the version recorded in the client manifest. While this is all well and good, imagine you’re an
administrator who now needs to reconfigure all client applications on a given machine to rebind to
version 2.0.0.0 of the CarLibrary.dll assembly. Given the strict naming convention of a configuration
file, you would need to duplicate the same XML content in numerous locations (assuming you are, in
fact, aware of the locations of the executables using CarLibrary!). Clearly this would be a maintenance
nightmare.</p>
<p>Publisher policy allows the publisher of a given assembly (you, your department, your company, or
what have you) to ship a binary version of a *.config file that is installed into the GAC along with the
newest version of the associated assembly. The benefit of this approach is that client application
directories do not need to contain specific *.config files. Rather, the CLR will read the current manifest
and attempt to find the requested version in the GAC. However, if the CLR finds a publisher policy assembly,
it will read the embedded XML data and perform the requested redirection at the level of the GAC.</p>
<p>Publisher policy assemblies are created at the command line using a .NET utility named al.exe (the
assembly linker). Though this tool provides many options, building a publisher policy assembly requires
passing in only the following input parameters:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The location of the *.config or *.xml file containing the redirecting instructions</li>
  <li>The name of the resulting publisher policy assembly</li>
 <li>The location of the *.snk file used to sign the publisher policy assembly</li>
 <li>The version numbers to assign the publisher policy assembly being constructed</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to build a publisher policy assembly that controls CarLibrary.dll, the command set is as
follows (which must be entered on a single line within the command window):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
al /link: CarLibraryPolicy.xml /out:policy.1.0.CarLibrary.dll
/keyf:C:\MyKey\myKey.snk /v:1.0.0.0
</pre>
<p>Here, the XML content is contained within a file named CarLibraryPolicy.xml. The name of the
output file (which must be in the format policy.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.assemblyToConfigure) is specified
using the obvious /out flag. In addition, note that the name of the file containing the public/private key
pair will also need to be supplied via the /keyf option. Remember, publisher policy files are shared, and
therefore must have strong names!</p>
<p>Once the al.exe tool has executed, the result is a new assembly that can be placed into the GAC to
force all clients to bind to version 2.0.0.0 of CarLibrary.dll, without the use of a specific client
application configuration file. Using this technique, you can design a machinewide redirection for all
applications using a specific version (or range of versions) of an existing assembly.</p>
<h2>Disabling Publisher Policy</h2>
<p>Now, assume you (as a system administrator) have deployed a publisher policy assembly (and the latest
version of the related assembly) to the GAC of a client machine. As luck would have it, nine of the ten
affected applications rebind to version 2.0.0.0 without error. However, the remaining client application
(for whatever reason) blows up when accessing CarLibrary.dll 2.0.0.0. (As we all know, it is next to
impossible to build backward-compatible software that works 100 percent of the time.)</p>
<p>In such a case, it is possible to build a configuration file for a specific troubled client that instructs
the CLR to ignore the presence of any publisher policy files installed in the GAC. The remaining client
applications that are happy to consume the newest .NET assembly will simply be redirected via the
installed publisher policy assembly. To disable publisher policy on a client-by-client basis, author a
(properly named) *.config file that makes use of the &lt;publisherPolicy&gt; element and set the apply
attribute to no. When you do so, the CLR will load the version of the assembly originally listed in the
client’s manifest.</p>
