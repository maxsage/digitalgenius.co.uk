<h1>Understanding the Connected Layer of ADO.NET</h1>
    <p>Recall that the connected layer of ADO.NET allows you to interact with a database using the connection,
command, and data reader objects of your data provider. You have already used these objects in the
previous DataProviderFactory application, now you’ll walk through the process again, this time using an
expanded example. You need to perform the following steps when you wish to connect to a database
and read the records using a data reader object:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Allocate, configure, and open your connection object.</li>
 <li>Allocate and configure a command object, specifying the connection object as
a constructor argument or with the Connection property.</li>
 <li>Call ExecuteReader() on the configured command class.</li>
 <li>Process each record using the Read() method of the data reader.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get the ball rolling, create a new Console Application named AutoLotDataReader and import the
System.Data and System.Data.SqlClient namespaces. Here is the complete code within Main(); an
analysis will follow:</p>

                <span class="str">@"Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=SSPI;"</span> +
                    <span class="str">"Initial Catalog=AutoLot"</span>;
            cn.Open();

                while (myDataReader.Read())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Make: {0}, PetName: {1}, Color: {2}."</span>,
                        myDataReader[<span class="str">"Make"</span>].ToString(),
                        myDataReader[<span class="str">"PetName"</span>].ToString(),
                        myDataReader[<span class="str">"Color"</span>].ToString());
                }
            }
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Working with Connection Objects</h2>
<p>The first step to take when working with a data provider is to establish a session with the data source
using the connection object (which, as you recall, derives from DbConnection). .NET connection objects
are provided with a formatted connection string; this string contains a number of name/value pairs,
separated by semicolons. You use this information to identify the name of the machine you wish to
connect to, required security settings, the name of the database on that machine, and other data
provider–specific information.</p>
<p>As you can infer from the preceding code, the Initial Catalog name refers to the database you
want to establish a session with. The Data Source name identifies the name of the machine that
maintains the database. Here, (local) allows you to define a single token to specify the current local
machine (regardless of the literal name of said machine), while the \SQLEXPRESS token informs the SQL
server provider that you are connecting to the default SQL Server Express edition installation (if you
created AutoLot on a full version of Microsoft SQL Server on your local computer, specify Data
Source=(local)).</p>
<p>Beyond this, you can supply any number of tokens that represent security credentials. Here, you set
the Integrated Security to SSPI (equivalent to true), which uses the current Windows account
credentials for user authentication.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Look up the ConnectionString property of your data provider’s connection object in the .NET
Framework 4.0 SDK documentation to learn more about each name/value pair for your specific DBMS.</p>
<p>Once you establish your construction string, you can use a call to Open() to establish a connection
with the DBMS. In addition to the ConnectionString, Open(), and Close() members, a connection object
provides a number of members that let you configure additional settings regarding your connection,
such as timeout settings and transactional information. Table 21-5 lists some (but not all) members of
the DbConnection base class.</p>
<p><b>Table 21-5.</b> Members of the DbConnection Type</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Member
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    BeginTransaction()
   </td>
   <td>
    You use this method to begin a database transaction.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

   </td>
   <td>
    You use this method to change the database on an open connection.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ConnectionTimeout
   </td>
   <td>
    This read-only property returns the amount of time to wait while
establishing a connection before terminating and generating an error
(the default value is 15 seconds). If you wish to change the default,
specify a Connect Timeout segment in the connection string (e.g.,
Connect Timeout=30).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Database
   </td>
   <td>
    This read-only property gets the name of the database maintained by
the connection object.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    DataSource
   </td>
   <td>
    This read-only property gets the location of the database maintained
by the connection object.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    GetSchema()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method returns a DataTable object that contains schema
information from the data source.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    State
   </td>
   <td>
    This read-only property gets the current state of the connection, which
is represented by the ConnectionState enumeration.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The properties of the DbConnection type are typically read-only in nature and are only useful when
you wish to obtain the characteristics of a connection at runtime. When you wish to override default
settings, you must alter the construction string itself. For example, the connection string sets the
connection timeout setting from 15 seconds to 30 seconds:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Data Readers *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlConnection cn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlConnection())
    {
        cn.ConnectionString =
            <span class="str">@"Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;"</span> +
            <span class="str">"Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=AutoLot;Connect Timeout=30"</span>;
        cn.Open();

        <span class="rem">// New helper function (see below).</span>
        ShowConnectionStatus(cn);
    ...
}</pre>
<p>In the preceding code, you pass your connection object as a parameter to a new static helper
method in the Program class named ShowConnectionStatus(), which you implement as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ShowConnectionStatus(SqlConnection cn)
{
    <span class="rem">// Show various stats about current connection object.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Info about your connection *****"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Database location: {0}"</span>, cn.DataSource);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Database name: {0}"</span>, cn.Database);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Timeout: {0}"</span>, cn.ConnectionTimeout);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Connection state: {0}\n"</span>, cn.State.ToString());
}</pre>
<p>While most of these properties are self-explanatory, the State property is worth special mention.
You can assign this property any value of the ConnectionState enumeration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> ConnectionState
{
    Broken, Closed,
    Connecting, Executing,
    Fetching, Open
}</pre>
<p>However, the only valid ConnectionState values are ConnectionState.Open and
ConnectionState.Closed (the remaining members of this enum are reserved for future use). Also, it is
always safe to close a connection where connection state is currently ConnectionState.Closed.</p>
<h2>Working with ConnectionStringBuilder Objects</h2>
<p>Working with connection strings programmatically can be cumbersome because they are often
represented as string literals, which are difficult to maintain and error-prone at best. The Microsoftsupplied
ADO.NET data providers support connection string builder objects, which allow you to establish
the name/value pairs using strongly typed properties. Consider the following update to the current
Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Data Readers *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Create a connection string via the builder object.</span>
    SqlConnectionStringBuilder cnStrBuilder =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlConnectionStringBuilder();
    cnStrBuilder.InitialCatalog = <span class="str">"AutoLot"</span>;
    cnStrBuilder.DataSource = <span class="str">@"(local)\SQLEXPRESS"</span>;
    cnStrBuilder.ConnectTimeout = 30;
    cnStrBuilder.IntegratedSecurity = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlConnection cn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlConnection())
    {
        cn.ConnectionString = cnStrBuilder.ConnectionString;
        cn.Open();

        ShowConnectionStatus(cn);
...
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>In this iteration, you create an instance of SqlConnectionStringBuilder, set the properties
accordingly, and obtain the internal string using the ConnectionString property. Also note that you use
the default constructor of the type. If you so choose, you can also create an instance of your data
provider’s connection string builder object by passing in an existing connection string as a starting point
(this can be helpful when you read these values dynamically from an App.config file). Once you have
hydrated the object with the initial string data, you can change specific name/value pairs using the
related properties, as in this example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Data Readers *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Assume you really obtained the cnStr value from a *.config file.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> cnStr = <span class="str">@"Data Source=(local)\SQLEXPRESS;"</span> +
        <span class="str">"Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=AutoLot"</span>;

    SqlConnectionStringBuilder cnStrBuilder =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlConnectionStringBuilder(cnStr);

    <span class="rem">// Change timeout value.</span>
    cnStrBuilder.ConnectTimeout = 5;
...
}</pre>
<h2>Working with Command Objects</h2>
<p>Now that you understand better the role of the connection object, the next order of business is to check
out how to submit SQL queries to the database in question. The SqlCommand type (which derives from
DbCommand) is an OO representation of a SQL query, table name, or stored procedure. You specify the type
of command using the CommandType property, which can take any value from the CommandType enum:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> CommandType
{
    StoredProcedure,
    TableDirect,
    Text <span class="rem">// Default value.</span>
}</pre>
<p>When you create a command object, you can establish the SQL query as a constructor parameter or
directly by using the CommandText property. Also when you create a command object, you need to specify
the connection you want to use. Again, you can do so as a constructor parameter or by using the
Connection property. Consider this code snippet:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Create command object via ctor args.</span>
<span class="kwrd">string</span> strSQL = <span class="str">"Select * From Inventory"</span>;
SqlCommand myCommand = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand(strSQL, cn);

<span class="rem">// Create another command object via properties.</span>
SqlCommand testCommand = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlCommand();
testCommand.Connection = cn;
testCommand.CommandText = strSQL;</pre>
<p>Realize that at this point that you have not literally submitted the SQL query to the AutoLot
database, but instead prepared the state of the command object for future use. Table 21-6 highlights
some additional members of the DbCommand type.</p>
<p><b>Table 21-6.</b> Members of the DbCommand Type</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Member
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Meaning in Life
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets the time to wait while executing the command before
terminating the attempt and generating an error. The default is 30 seconds.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Connection
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets the DbConnection used by this instance of the DbCommand.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Parameters
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets the collection of DbParameter objects used for a parameterized query.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Cancel()
   </td>
   <td>
    Cancels the execution of a command.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ExecuteReader()
   </td>
   <td>
    Executes a SQL query and returns the data provider’s DbDataReader object,
which provides forward-only, read-only access for the result of the query.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ExecuteNonQuery()
   </td>
   <td>
    Executes a SQL non-query (e.g., an insert, update, delete, or create table).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ExecuteScalar()
   </td>
   <td>
    A lightweight version of the ExecuteReader() method that was designed
specifically for singleton queries (e.g., obtaining a record count).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Prepare()
   </td>
   <td>
    Creates a prepared (or compiled) version of the command on the data
source. As you might know, a prepared query executes slightly faster and is
useful when you wish to execute the same query multiple times (typically
with different parameters each time).
   </td>
  </tr>
