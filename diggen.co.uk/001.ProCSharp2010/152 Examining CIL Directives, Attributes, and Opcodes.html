<h1>Examining CIL Directives, Attributes, and Opcodes</h1>
    <p>When you begin to investigate low-level languages such as CIL, you are guaranteed to find new (and
often intimidating-sounding) names for very familiar concepts. For example, at this point in the text, if
you were shown the following set of items</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
{new, public, this, base, get, set, explicit, unsafe, enum, operator, partial}</pre>
<p>you would most certainly understand them to be keywords of the C# language (which is correct).
However, if you look more closely at the members of this set, you may be able to see that while each item
is indeed a C# keyword, it has radically different semantics. For example, the enum keyword defines a
System.Enum-derived type, while the this and base keywords allow you to reference the current object or
the object’s parent class, respectively. The unsafe keyword is used to establish a block of code that
cannot be directly monitored by the CLR, while the operator keyword allows you to build a hidden
(specially named) method that will be called when you apply a specific C# operator (such as the plus
sign).</p>
<p>In stark contrast to a higher-level language such as C#, CIL does not just simply define a general set
of keywords, per se. Rather, the token set understood by the CIL compiler is subdivided into three broad
categories based on semantics:</p>
<ul>
 <li>CIL directives</li>
 <li>CIL attributes</li>
 <li>CIL operation codes (opcodes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category of CIL token is expressed using a particular syntax, and the tokens are combined to
build a valid .NET assembly.</p>
<h2>The Role of CIL Directives</h2>
<p>First up, there is a set of well-known CIL tokens that are used to describe the overall structure of a .NET
assembly. These tokens are called directives. CIL directives are used to inform the CIL compiler how to
define the namespaces(s), type(s), and member(s) that will populate an assembly.</p>
<p>Directives are represented syntactically using a single dot (.) prefix (e.g., .namespace, .class,
.publickeytoken, .method, .assembly, etc.). Thus, if your *.il file (the conventional extension for a file
containing CIL code) has a single .namespace directive and three .class directives, the CIL compiler will
generate an assembly that defines a single .NET namespace containing three .NET class types.</p>
<h2>The Role of CIL Attributes</h2>
<p>In many cases, CIL directives in and of themselves are not descriptive enough to fully express the
definition of a given .NET type or type member. Given this fact, many CIL directives can be further
specified with various CIL attributes to qualify how a directive should be processed. For example, the
.class directive can be adorned with the public attribute (to establish the type visibility), the extends
attribute (to explicitly specify the type’s base class), and the implements attribute (to list the set of
interfaces supported by the type).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Don’t confuse a “.NET attribute” (see Chapter 15) with that of a “CIL attribute,” the two are very different
concepts.</p>
<h2>The Role of CIL Opcodes</h2>
<p>Once a .NET assembly, namespace, and type set have been defined in terms of CIL using various directives
and related attributes, the final remaining task is to provide the type’s implementation logic. This is a job
for operation codes, or simply opcodes. In the tradition of other low-level languages, many CIL opcodes
tend to be cryptic and completely unpronounceable by us mere humans. For example, if you need to load a
string variable into memory, you don’t use a friendly opcode named LoadString, but rather ldstr</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, some CIL opcodes do map quite naturally to their C# counterparts (e.g., box, unbox,
throw, and sizeof). As you will see, the opcodes of CIL are always used within the scope of a member’s
implementation, and unlike CIL directives, they are never written with a dot prefix.</p>
<h2>The CIL Opcode/CIL Mnemonic Distinction</h2>
<p>As just explained, opcodes such as ldstr are used to implement the members of a given type. In reality,
however, tokens such as ldstr are CIL mnemonics for the actual binary CIL opcodes. To clarify the
distinction, assume you have authored the following method in C#:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
{
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y;
}</pre>
<p>The act of adding two numbers is expressed in terms of the CIL opcode 0X58. In a similar vein,
subtracting two numbers is expressed using the opcode 0X59, and the act of allocating a new object on
the managed heap is achieved using the 0X73 opcode. Given this reality, understand that the “CIL code”
processed by a JIT compiler is actually nothing more than blobs of binary data.</p>
<p>Thankfully, for each binary opcode of CIL, there is a corresponding mnemonic. For example, the add
mnemonic can be used rather than 0X58, sub rather than 0X59, and newobj rather than 0X73. Given this
opcode/mnemonic distinction, realize that CIL decompilers such as ildasm.exe translate an assembly’s
binary opcodes into their corresponding CIL mnemonics. For example, here would be the CIL presented
by ildasm.exe for the previous C# Add() method:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static int32 Add(int32 x,
    int32 y) cil managed
{
    // Code size 9 (0x9)
    .maxstack 2
    .locals init ([0] int32 CS$1$0000)
    IL_0000: nop
    IL_0001: ldarg.0
    IL_0002: ldarg.1
    IL_0003: add
    IL_0004: stloc.0
    IL_0005: br.s IL_0007
    IL_0007: ldloc.0
    IL_0008: ret
}</pre>
<p>Unless you’re building some extremely low-level .NET software (such as a custom managed
compiler), you’ll never need to concern yourself with the literal numeric binary opcodes of CIL. For all
practical purposes, when .NET programmers speak about “CIL opcodes” they’re referring to the set of
friendly string token mnemonics (as I’ve done within this text, and will do for the remainder of this
chapter) rather than the underlying numerical values.</p>
