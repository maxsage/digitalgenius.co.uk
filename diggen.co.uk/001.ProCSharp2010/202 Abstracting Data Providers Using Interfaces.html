<h1>Abstracting Data Providers Using Interfaces</h1>
<p>At this point, you should have a better idea of the common functionality found among all .NET data
providers. Recall that even though the exact names of the implementing types will differ among data
providers, you can program against these types in a similar manner—that’s the beauty of interfacebased
polymorphism. For example, if you define a method that takes an IDbConnection parameter, you
can pass in any ADO.NET connection object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OpenConnection(IDbConnection cn)
{
    <span class="rem">// Open the incoming connection for the caller.</span>
    cn.Open();
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> Interfaces are not strictly required; you can achieve the same level of abstraction using abstract base
classes (such as DbConnection) as parameters or return values.</p>
<p>The same holds true for member return values. For example, consider the following simple C#
Console Application project (named MyConnectionFactory), which allows you to obtain a specific
connection object based on the value of a custom enumeration. For diagnostic purposes, you simply
print out the underlying connection object using reflection services, and then enter the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="rem">// Need these to get definitions of common interfaces,</span>
<span class="rem">// and various connection objects for our test.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Data;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Data.SqlClient;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Data.Odbc;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Data.OleDb;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MyConnectionFactory
{
    <span class="rem">// A list of possible providers.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">enum</span> DataProvider
    { SqlServer, OleDb, Odbc, None }

    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"**** Very Simple Connection Factory *****\n"</span>);

            <span class="rem">// Get a specific connection.</span>
            IDbConnection myCn = GetConnection(DataProvider.SqlServer);
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Your connection is a {0}"</span>, myCn.GetType().Name);

            <span class="rem">// Open, use and close connection...</span>

            Console.ReadLine();
        }

        <span class="rem">// This method returns a specific connection object</span>
        <span class="rem">// based on the value of a DataProvider enum.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> IDbConnection GetConnection(DataProvider dp)
        {
            IDbConnection conn = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
            <span class="kwrd">switch</span> (dp)
            {
                <span class="kwrd">case</span> DataProvider.SqlServer:
                    conn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SqlConnection();
                    <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
                <span class="kwrd">case</span> DataProvider.OleDb:
                    conn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> OleDbConnection();
                    <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
                <span class="kwrd">case</span> DataProvider.Odbc:
                    conn = <span class="kwrd">new</span> OdbcConnection();
                    <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
            }
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> conn;
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>The benefit of working with the general interfaces of System.Data (or for that matter, the abstract
base classes of System.Data.Common) is that you have a much better chance of building a flexible code
base that can evolve over time. For example, today you might be building an application that targets
Microsoft SQL Server; however, it’s possible your company could switch to Oracle months down the
road. If you build a solution that hard-codes the MS SQL Server–specific types of System.Data.SqlClient,
you would obviously need to edit, recompile, and redeploy the assembly should the back-end database
management system change.</p>
<h2>Increasing Flexibility Using Application Configuration Files</h2>
<p>To increase the flexibility of your ADO.NET applications, you could incorporate a client-side *.config
file that uses custom key/value pairs within the &lt;appSettings&gt; element. Recall from Chapter 14 that you
can obtain the custom data stored within a *.config file programmatically by using types within the
System.Configuration namespace. For example, assume you have specified a data provider value within
a configuration file, as in this example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">appSettings</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="rem">&lt;!-- This key value maps to one of our enum values--&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">add</span> <span class="attr">key</span><span class="kwrd">="provider"</span> <span class="attr">value</span><span class="kwrd">="SqlServer"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">appSettings</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">configuration</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>With this, you could update Main() to obtain the underlying data provider programmatically. Doing
this essentially builds a connection object factory that allows you to change the provider, but without
requiring you to recompile your code base (you simply change the *.config file). Here are the relevant
updates to Main():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"**** Very Simple Connection Factory *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Read the provider key.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> dataProvString = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[<span class="str">"provider"</span>];

    <span class="rem">// Transform string to enum.</span>
    DataProvider dp = DataProvider.None;
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(Enum.IsDefined(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(DataProvider), dataProvString))
        dp = (DataProvider)Enum.Parse(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(DataProvider), dataProvString);
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Sorry, no provider exists!"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Get a specific connection.</span>
    IDbConnection myCn = GetConnection(dp);
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(myCn != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Your connection is a {0}"</span>, myCn.GetType().Name);

    <span class="rem">// Open, use, and close connection...</span>

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> To use the ConfigurationManager type, be sure to set a reference to the
System.Configuration.dll assembly and import the System.Configuration namespace.</p>
<p>At this point, you have authored some ADO.NET code that allows you to specify the underlying
connection dynamically. One obvious problem, however, is that this abstraction is only used within the
MyConnectionFactory.exe application. If you were to rework this example within a .NET code library
(e.g., MyConnectionFactory.dll), you would be able to build any number of clients that could obtain
various connection objects using layers of abstraction.</p>
<p>However, obtaining a connection object is only one aspect of working with ADO.NET. To make a
worthwhile data provider factory library, you would also have to account for command objects, data
readers, data adapters, transaction objects, and other data-centric types. Building such a code library
would not necessarily be difficult, but it would require a considerable amount of code and time.</p>
<p>Since the release of .NET 2.0, the kind folks in Redmond have built this exact functionality directly
into the .NET base class libraries. You will examine this formal API in just a moment; however, first you
need to create a custom database to use throughout this chapter (and for many chapters to come).</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> You can find the MyConnectionFactory project under the Chapter 21 subdirectory.</p>
