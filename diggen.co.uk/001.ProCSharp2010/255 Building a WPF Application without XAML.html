<h1>Building a WPF Application without XAML</h1>
<p>Given all of the functionality provided by the parent classes of the Window type, it is possible to represent
a window in your application by either directly creating a Window object or using this class as the parent
to a strongly typed descendent. Let’s examine both approaches in the following code example. Although
most WPF applications will make use of XAML, doing so is entirely optional. Anything that can be
expressed in XAML can be expressed in code and (for the most part) vice versa. If you wish, it is possible
to build a complete WPF project using the underlying object model and procedural code.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let’s create a minimal but complete application without the use of XAML using the
Application and Window classes directly. Begin by creating a new Console Application named
WpfAppAllCode (don't worry, you will use the Visual Studio WPF project template later in this chapter).
Next, access the Project | Add Reference dialog box and add a reference to WindowsBase.dll,
PresentationCore.dll, System.Xaml.dll and PresentationFramework.dll.</p>
<p>Now, update your initial C# file with the following code, which creates a window of modest
functionality:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple WPF application, written without XAML.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Windows;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Windows.Controls;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> WpfAppAllCode
{
    <span class="rem">// In this first example, you are defining a single class type to</span>
    <span class="rem">// represent the application itself and the main window.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program : Application
    {
        [STAThread]
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            <span class="rem">// Handle the Startup and Exit events, and then run the application.</span>
            Program app = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Program();
            app.Startup += AppStartUp;
            app.Exit += AppExit;
            app.Run(); <span class="rem">// Fires the Startup event.</span>
        }
    
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AppExit(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, ExitEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"App has exited"</span>);
        }

        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AppStartUp(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, StartupEventArgs e)
        {
            <span class="rem">// Create a Window object and set some basic properties.</span>
            Window mainWindow = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Window();
            mainWindow.Title = <span class="str">"My First WPF App!"</span>;
            mainWindow.Height = 200;
            mainWindow.Width = 300;
            mainWindow.WindowStartupLocation = WindowStartupLocation.CenterScreen;
            mainWindow.Show();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> The Main() method of a WPF application must be attributed with the [STAThread] attribute, which
ensures any legacy COM objects used by your application are thread-safe. If you do not annotate Main() in this
way, you will encounter a runtime exception.</p>
<p>Note that the Program class extends the System.Windows.Application class. Within the Main()
method, you create an instance of the application object and handle the Startup and Exit events using
method group conversion syntax. Recall from Chapter 11 that this shorthand notation removes the need
to manually specify the underlying delegates used by a particular event.</p>
<p>Of course, if you wish, you can specify the underlying delegates directly by name. In the
following modified Main() method, notice that the Startup event works in conjunction with the
StartupEventHandler delegate, which can only point to methods taking an Object as the first
parameter and a StartupEventArgs as the second. The Exit event, on the other hand, works with
the ExitEventHandler delegate, which demands that the method pointed to take an ExitEventArgs
type as the second parameter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[STAThread]
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// This time, specify the underlying delegates.</span>
    MyWPFApp app = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyWPFApp();
    app.Startup += <span class="kwrd">new</span> StartupEventHandler(AppStartUp);
    app.Exit += <span class="kwrd">new</span> ExitEventHandler(AppExit);
    app.Run(); <span class="rem">// Fires the Startup event.</span>
}</pre>
<p>In any case, the AppStartUp() method has been configured to create a Window object, establish some
very basic property settings, and call Show() to display the window on the screen in a modeless fashion
(the ShowDialog() method can be used to launch a modal dialog). The AppExit() method simply makes
use of the WPF MessageBox class to display a diagnostic message when the application is being
terminated.</p>
<p>Once you compile and run the project, you will find a very simple main window that can be
minimized, maximized, and closed. To spice things up a bit, you need to add some user interface
elements. Before you do, however, you should refactor your code base to account for a strongly typed
and well-encapsulated Window-derived class.</p>
<h2>Creating a Strongly Typed Window</h2>
<p>Currently, the Application-derived class directly creates an instance of the Window type upon application
startup. Ideally, you would create a class deriving from Window in order to encapsulate its appearance
and functionality. Assume that you have created the following class definition within your current
WpfAppAllCode namespace (if you place this class in a new C# file, be sure to import the System.Windows
namespace):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MainWindow : Window
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MainWindow(<span class="kwrd">string</span> windowTitle, <span class="kwrd">int</span> height, <span class="kwrd">int</span> width)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Title = windowTitle;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.WindowStartupLocation = WindowStartupLocation.CenterScreen;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Height = height;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Width = width;
    }
}</pre>
<p>You can now update your Startup event handler to simply directly create an instance of MainWindow:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AppStartUp(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, StartupEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Create a MainWindow object.</span>
    MainWindow wnd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MainWindow(<span class="str">"My better WPF App!"</span>, 200, 300);
    wnd.Show();
}</pre>
<p>Once the program is recompiled and executed, the output is identical. The obvious benefit is that
you now have a strongly typed window class to build upon.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> When you create a Window (or Window-derived) object, it will automatically be added to the windows
collection of the Application class (via some constructor logic found in the Window class itself). You can use
the Application.Windows property to iterate over the list of Window objects currently in memory.</p>
<h2>Creating a Simple User Interface</h2>
<p>Adding a UI element to a Window in C# code will involve the following basic steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Define a member variable to represent the control.</li>
 <li>Configure the control’s look and feel upon Window construction.</li>
 <li>Assign the control to the inherited Content property, or alternatively, as a
parameter to the inherited AddChild() method.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recall that the WPF control content model demands that the Content property is set only once. Of
course, a Window that only contained a single UI control would be quite useless. Therefore, in almost
every case, the "single piece of content" that is assigned to the Content property is, in reality, a layout
manager, such as DockPanel, Grid, Canvas, or StackPanel. Within the layout manager, you can have any
combination of internal controls, including other nested layout managers. (Read more on this aspect of
WPF development in Chapter 28.)</p>
 <p>For now, you will add a single Button control to your Window derived class. When you click the
button, you will close the current window, which will indirectly terminate the application, as you have
no other windows in memory. Ponder the following update to the MainWindow class (be sure you have
imported System.Windows.Controls to gain access to the Button class):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MainWindow : Window
{
    <span class="rem">// Our UI element.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Button btnExitApp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Button();

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MainWindow(<span class="kwrd">string</span> windowTitle, <span class="kwrd">int</span> height, <span class="kwrd">int</span> width)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Configure button and set the child control.</span>
        btnExitApp.Click += <span class="kwrd">new</span> RoutedEventHandler(btnExitApp_Clicked);
        btnExitApp.Content = <span class="str">"Exit Application"</span>;
        btnExitApp.Height = 25;
        btnExitApp.Width = 100;

        <span class="rem">// Set the content of this window to a single button.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Content = btnExitApp;

        <span class="rem">// Configure the window.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Title = windowTitle;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.WindowStartupLocation = WindowStartupLocation.CenterScreen;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Height = height;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Width = width;
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Show();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnExitApp_Clicked(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Close the window.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Close();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the Click event of the WPF Button works in conjunction with a delegate named
RoutedEventHandler, which begs the question, what is a routed event? You’ll examine the details of the
WPF event model in the next chapter; for the time being, simply understand that targets of the
RoutedEventHandler delegate must supply an object as the first parameter and a RoutedEventArgs as the
second.</p>
<p>In any case, once you recompile and run this application, you will find the customized window
shown in Figure 27-6. Notice that your button is automatically placed in the dead center of the window’s
client area; this is the default behavior when content is not placed within a WPF panel type.</p>

<h2>Interacting with Application Level Data</h2>
<p>Recall that the Application class defines a property named Properties, which allows you to define a
collection of name/value pairs via a type indexer. Because this indexer has been defined to operate on
type System.Object, you are able to store any sort of item within this collection (including your custom
classes), to be retrieved at a later time using a friendly moniker. Using this approach, it is simple to share
data across all windows in a WPF application.</p>
<p>To illustrate, you will update the current Startup event handler to check the incoming commandline
arguments for a value named /GODMODE (a common cheat code for many PC video games). If you find
this token, you will establish a bool value set to true within the properties collection of the same name
(otherwise you will set the value to false).</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but how are you going to pass the incoming command-line arguments
(typically obtained from the Main() method) to your Startup event handler? One approach is to call the
static Environment.GetCommandLineArgs() method. However, these same arguments are automatically
added to the incoming StartupEventArgs parameter and can be accessed via the Args property. That
being said, here is the first update to the current code base:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AppStartUp(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, StartupEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Check the incoming command-line arguments and see if they</span>
    <span class="rem">// specified a flag for /GODMODE.</span>

    Application.Current.Properties[<span class="str">"GodMode"</span>] = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span> arg <span class="kwrd">in</span> e.Args)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (arg.ToLower() == <span class="str">"/godmode"</span>)
        {
            Application.Current.Properties[<span class="str">"GodMode"</span>] = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
            <span class="kwrd">break</span>;
        }
    }

    <span class="rem">// Create a MainWindow object.</span>
    MainWindow wnd = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MainWindow(<span class="str">"My better WPF App!"</span>, 200, 300);
}</pre>
<p>Application-wide data can be accessed from anywhere within the WPF application. All you are
required to do is obtain an access point to the global application object (via Application.Current) and
investigate the collection. For example, you could update the Click event handler of the Button as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnExitApp_Clicked(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Did user enable /godmode?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>((<span class="kwrd">bool</span>)Application.Current.Properties[<span class="str">"GodMode"</span>])
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"Cheater!"</span>);
    
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Close();
}</pre>
<p>With this, if the end user launches our program as follows:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
WpfAppAllCode.exe /godmode</pre>
<p>he or she will see our shameful message box displayed when terminating the application.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Recall that you can supply command line arguments within Visual Studio. Simply double click on the
Properties icon within Solution Explorer, click the Debug tab from the resulting editor, and enter /godmode within
the "Command line arguments" editor.</p>
<h2>Handling the Closing of a Window Object</h2>
<p>End users can shut down a window using numerous built-in system-level techniques (e.g., clicking the
“X” close button on the window’s frame) or by indirectly calling the Close() method in response to some
user interaction element (e.g., File &gt; Exit). In either case, WPF provides two events that you can
intercept to determine if the user is truly ready to shut down the window and remove it from memory.
The first event to fire is Closing, which works in conjunction with the CancelEventHandler delegate.</p>
<p>This delegate expects target methods to take System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs as the second
parameter. CancelEventArgs provides the Cancel property, which when set to true will prevent the
window from actually closing (this is handy when you have asked the user if he really wants to close the
window or if perhaps he would like to save his work first).</p>
<p>If the user did indeed wish to close the window, CancelEventArgs.Cancel can be set to false. This
will then cause the Closed event to fire (which works with the System.EventHandler delegate), making it
the point at which the window is about to be closed for good.</p>
<p>Update the MainWindow class to handle these two events by adding these code statements to the
current constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> MainWindow(<span class="kwrd">string</span> windowTitle, <span class="kwrd">int</span> height, <span class="kwrd">int</span> width)
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Closing += MainWindow_Closing;
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Closed += MainWindow_Closed;
}</pre>
<p>Now, implement the corresponding event handlers as so:</p>
<<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MainWindow_Closing(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender,
    System.ComponentModel.CancelEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// See if the user really wants to shut down this window.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> msg = <span class="str">"Do you want to close without saving?"</span>;
    MessageBoxResult result = MessageBox.Show(msg,
        <span class="str">"My App"</span>, MessageBoxButton.YesNo, MessageBoxImage.Warning);

    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (result == MessageBoxResult.No)
    {
        <span class="rem">// If user doesn't want to close, cancel closure.</span>
        e.Cancel = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    }
}

<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MainWindow_Closed(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"See ya!"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>Now, run your program and attempt to close the window, either by clicking the "X" icon on the
upper right of the window or by clicking the button control. You should see the following confirmation
dialog (Figure 27-7).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure27_07.png" alt="Figure 27-7" />
<p><b>Figure 27-7</b> Trapping the Closing event of a Window</p>
<p>If you click the Yes button, the application will terminate; however, clicking the No button will keep
the window in memory.</p>
<h2>Intercepting Mouse Events</h2>
<p>The WPF API provides a number of events you can capture in order to interact with the mouse.
Specifically, the UIElement base class defines a number of mouse-centric events such as MouseMove,
MouseUp, MouseDown, MouseEnter, MouseLeave, and so forth.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the act of handling the MouseMove event. This event works in conjunction
with the System.Windows.Input.MouseEventHandler delegate, which expects its target to take a
System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs type as the second parameter. Using MouseEventArgs (like a
Windows Forms application), you are able to extract out the (x, y) position of the mouse and other
relevant details. Consider the following partial definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MouseEventArgs : InputEventArgs
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Point GetPosition(IInputElement relativeTo);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MouseButtonState LeftButton { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MouseButtonState MiddleButton { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MouseDevice MouseDevice { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MouseButtonState RightButton { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> StylusDevice StylusDevice { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MouseButtonState XButton1 { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MouseButtonState XButton2 { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> The XButton1 and XButton2 properties allow you to interact with "extended mouse buttons" (such as the
"next" and "previous" buttons found on some mouse controls). These are often used to interact with a browser's
history list to navigate between visited pages.</p>
<p>The GetPosition() method allows you to get the (x, y) value relative to a UI element on the window.
If you are interested in capturing the position relative to the activated window, simply pass in this.
Handle the MouseMove event in the constructor of your MainWindow class like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> MainWindow(<span class="kwrd">string</span> windowTitle, <span class="kwrd">int</span> height, <span class="kwrd">int</span> width)
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.MouseMove += MainWindow_MouseMove;
}</pre>
<p>Here is an event handler for MouseMove that will display the location of the mouse in the window’s
title area (notice you are translating the returned Point type into a text value via ToString()):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MainWindow_MouseMove(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender,
System.Windows.Input.MouseEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Set the title of the window to the current X,Y of the mouse.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Title = e.GetPosition(<span class="kwrd">this</span>).ToString();
}</pre>
<h2>Intercepting Keyboard Events</h2>
<p>Processing keyboard input is also very straightforward. UIElement defines a number of events that you
can capture to intercept keypresses from the keyboard on the active element (e.g., KeyUp, KeyDown). The
KeyUp and KeyDown events both work with the System.Windows.Input.KeyEventHandler delegate, which
expects the target’s second event handler to be of type KeyEventArgs, which defines several public
properties of interest:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> KeyEventArgs : KeyboardEventArgs
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsDown { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsRepeat { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsToggled { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsUp { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Key Key { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> KeyStates KeyStates { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Key SystemKey { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>To illustrate handling the KeyDown event in the constructor of MainWindow (just like you did for the
previous events) and implement the following event handler that changes the content of the button with
the currently pressed key, use this code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MainWindow_KeyDown(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, System.Windows.Input.KeyEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Display key press on the button.</span>
    btnExitApp.Content = e.Key.ToString();
}</pre>
<p>As a finishing touch, double click on the Properties icon of the Solution Explorer, and under the
Application tab, set the Output Type setting to Windows Application. This will prevent the console
window from launching in the background of your WPF application. Figure 27-8 shows the final product
of your first WPF program.</p>

<p>At this point in the chapter, WPF might look like nothing more than yet another GUI framework that
is providing (more or less) the same services as Windows Forms, MFC or VB6. If this were in fact the
case, you might question the need for yet another UI toolkit. To truly see what makes WPF so unique
requires an understanding of the XML-based grammar, XAML.</p>
