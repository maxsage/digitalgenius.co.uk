<h1>Creating the AutoLot Database</h1>
<p>As you work through this chapter, you will execute queries against a simple SQL Server test database
named AutoLot. In keeping with the automotive theme used throughout this book, this database will
contain three interrelated tables (Inventory, Orders, and Customers) that contain various bits of data
representing order information for a fictional automobile sales company.</p>
<p>The assumption in this book is that you have a copy of Microsoft SQL Server (7.0 or higher) or a copy
of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Express Edition (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/sql). This
lightweight database server is perfect for your needs in this book: it is free, it provides a GUI front end
(the SQL Server Management Tool) to create and administer your databases, and it integrates with
Visual Studio 2010/Visual C# 2010 Express Edition.</p>
<p>To illustrate the last point, the remainder of this section will walk you through the construction of
the AutoLot database using Visual Studio 2010. If you use Visual C# Express, you can perform operations
similar to what is explained here by using the Database Explorer window (you can load this from the
View &gt; Other Windows menu option).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You will use the AutoLot database throughout the rest of this book</p>
<h2>Creating the Inventory Table</h2>
<p>To begin building your testing database, launch Visual Studio 2010 and open the Server Explorer using
the View menu of the IDE. Next, right-click the Data Connections node and select the Create New SQL
Server Database menu option. In the resulting dialog box, connect to the SQL Server installation on your
local machine (with the (local) token) and specify AutoLot as the database name (Windows
Authentication should be fine; see Figure 21-3).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If you use SQL Server Express, you will need to enter (local)\SQLEXPRESS in the Server name text box.</p>

<p><b>Figure 21-3</b> Creating a new SQL Server 2008 Express database with Visual Studio 2010</p>
<p>At this point, the AutoLot database is empty of any database objects (e.g., tables and stored
procedures). To insert a new database table, right-click the Tables node and select Add New Table (see
Figure 21-4).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_04.png" alt="Figure 21-4" />
<p><b>Figure 21-4</b> Adding the Inventory table</p>
<p>Use the table editor to add four columns (CarID, Make, Color, and PetName). Ensure that the CarID
column has been set to the Primary Key (do this by right-clicking the CarID row and selecting Set Primary
Key). Figure 21-5 shows the final table settings (you don’t need to change anything in the Column
Properties editor, but you should notice the data types for each column).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_05.png" alt="Figure 21-5" />
<p><b>Figure 21-5</b> Designing the Inventory table</p>
<p>Save (and then close) your new table; also, be sure you name this new database object Inventory. At
this point, you should see the Inventory table under the Tables node of the Server Explorer. Right-click
the Inventory table icon and select Show Table Data. Enter a handful of new automobiles of your
choosing (to make it interesting, be sure to include some cars that have identical colors and makes).
Figure 21-6 shows one possible list of inventory.</p>

<h2>Authoring the GetPetName() Stored Procedure</h2>
<p>Later in this chapter in the chapter, you will learn how to use ADO.NET to invoke stored procedures. As
you might already know, stored procedures are routines stored within a particular database that operate
often on table data to yield a return value. you will add a single stored procedure that will return an
automobile’s pet name, based on the supplied CarID value. To do so, right-click the Stored Procedures
node of the AutoLot database within the Server Explorer and select Add New Stored Procedure. Enter the
following in the editor that pops up:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">CREATE</span> <span class="kwrd">PROCEDURE</span> GetPetName
@carID <span class="kwrd">int</span>,
@petName <span class="kwrd">char</span>(10) <span class="kwrd">output</span>
<span class="kwrd">AS</span>
<span class="kwrd">SELECT</span> @petName = PetName <span class="kwrd">from</span> Inventory <span class="kwrd">where</span> CarID = @carID</pre>
<p>When you save your procedure, it will automatically be named GetPetName, based on your CREATE
PROCEDURE statement (note that Visual Studio 2010 automatically changes the SQL Script to “ALTER
PROCEDURE...” as soon as you save it for the first time). Once you do this, you should see your new stored
procedure within the Server Explorer (see Figure 21-7).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Stored procedures do not have to return data using output parameters, as shown here; however, doing
things this way sets the stage for talking about the Direction property of the SqlParameter later in this
chapter</p>

<h2>Creating the Customers and Orders Tables</h2>
<p>Your testing database will have two additional tables: Customers and Orders. The Customers table (as the
name suggests) will contain a list of customers; these which will be represented by three columns:
CustID (which should be set as the primary key), FirstName, and LastName. You can create the Customers
table by following the same steps you used to create the Inventory table; be sure to create the Customers
table using the schema shown in Figure 21-8.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_08.png" alt="Figure 21-8" />
<p><b>Figure 21-8</b> Designing the Customers table</p>
<p>After you save your table, add a handful of customer records (see Figure 21-9).</p>
<p><b>Figure 21-9</b> Populating the Customers table</p>
<p>You will use your final table, Orders, to represent the automobile a given customer is interested in
purchasing. Do this by mapping OrderID values to CarID/CustID values. Figure 21-10 shows the
structure of your final table (again, note that OrderID is the primary key).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_10.png" alt="Figure 21-10" />
<p><b>Figure 21-10</b> </p>
<p>Now add data to your Orders table. Assuming that the OrderID value begins at 1000, select a unique
CarID for each CustID value (see Figure 21-11).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_11.png" alt="Figure 21-11" />
<p><b>Figure 21-11</b> Populating the Orders table</p>
<p>For example, the entries used in this text indicate that Dave Brenner (CustID = 1) is interested in the
black BMW (CarID = 1000), while Pat Walton (CustID = 4) has her eye on the pink Saab (CarID = 1992).</p>
<h2>Visually Creating Table Relationships</h2>
<p>The final task is to establish parent/child table relationships between the Customers, Orders, and
Inventory tables. It is easy to do this using Visual Studio 2010 because you can elect to insert a new
database diagram at design time. Using the Server Explorer, right-click the Database Diagrams node of
the AutoLot database and select the Add New Diagram menu option. This brings up a dialog box that lets
you pick which tables to add to the diagram. Be sure to select each of the tables from the AutoLot
database (Figure 21-12).</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure21_12.png" alt="Figure 21-12" />
<p><b>Figure 21-12</b> Selecting tables for your diagram</p>
<p>You can begin establishing the relationships between the tables by clicking the CarID key of the
Inventory table and (while holding down the mouse button) drag it to the CarID field of the Orders table.
Once you release the mouse, accept all defaults from the resulting dialog boxes.</p>
<p>Now repeat the same process to map the CustID key of the Customers table to the CustID field of the
Orders table. Once you do this , you should see the class dialog box shown in Figure 21-13 (note that you
enable the display of the table relationship labels by right-clicking the designer and selecting Show
Relationship Labels).</p>

<p>With this, the AutoLot database is complete! This is a far cry from a real-world corporate database,
but it will serve your needs over the remainder of this book. Now that you have a database to test with,
you can dive into the details of the ADO.NET data provider factory model.</p>
