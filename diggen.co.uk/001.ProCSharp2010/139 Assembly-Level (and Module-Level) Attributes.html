<h1>Assembly-Level (and Module-Level) Attributes</h1>
    <p>It is also possible to apply attributes on all types within a given module (for a multi-file assembly; see
Chapter 14) or all modules within a given assembly using the [module:] and [assembly:] tags,
respectively. For example, assume you wish to ensure that every public member of every public type
defined within your assembly is CLS compliant.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Chapter 1 mentioned the role of CLS compliant assemblies. Recall that a CLS compliant assembly can be
used by all .NET programming languages out-of-the-box. If you create public members of public types which
expose non-CLS compliant programming constructs (such as unsigned data or pointer parameters), other .NET
languages may not be able to use your functionality. Therefore, if you are building C# code libraries which need to
be used by a wide variety of .NET languages, checking for CLS compliance is a must.</p>
<p>To do so, simply add the following assembly level attribute at the very top of any C# source code file.
Be very aware that all assembly or module-level attributes must be listed outside the scope of any
namespace scope! If you add assembly (or module) level attributes to your project, here is a
recommended file-layout to follow:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// List 'using' statements first.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="rem">// Now list any assembly/module level attributes.</span>
<span class="rem">// Enforce CLS compliance for all public types in this assembly.</span>
[assembly: CLSCompliant(<span class="kwrd">true</span>)]

<span class="rem">// Now, your namespace(s) and types.</span>
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> AttributedCarLibrary
{
    <span class="rem">// Types...</span>
}</pre>
<p>If you now add a bit of code that falls outside the CLS specification (such as an exposed point of
unsigned data):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Ulong types don't jibe with the CLS.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Winnebago
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">ulong</span> notCompliant;
}</pre>
<p>you are issued a compiler warning.</p>
<h2>The Visual Studio 2010 AssemblyInfo.cs File</h2>
<p>By default, Visual Studio 2010 projects receive a file named AssemblyInfo.cs, which can be viewed by
expanding the Properties icon of the Solution Explorer (see Figure 15-6).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure15_06.png" alt="Figure 15-6" />
<p><b>Figure 15-6</b> Figure Text</p>
<p>This file is a handy place to put attributes that are to be applied at the assembly level. You may recall
from Chapter 14, during the examination of .NET assemblies, that the manifest contains assembly-level
metadata, much of which comes from the assembly-level attributes shown in Table 15-4.</p>
