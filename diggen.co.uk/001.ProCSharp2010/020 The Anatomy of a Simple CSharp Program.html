    <h1>The Anatomy of a Simple C# Program</h1>
    <p>C# demands that all program logic be contained within a type definition (recall from Chapter 1 that type
    is a general term referring to a member of the set {class, interface, structure, enumeration, delegate}).
    Unlike many other languages, in C# it is not possible to create global functions or global points of data.
    Rather, all data members and methods must be contained within a type definition. To get the ball
    rolling, create a new Console Application project named SimpleCSharpApp. You might agree that the
    code within the initial Program.cs file is rather uneventful.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections.Generic;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Linq;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> SimpleCSharpApp
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Given this, update the Main() method of your Program class with the following code statements:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Display a simple message to the user.</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** My First C# App *****"</span>);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello World!"</span>);
        Console.WriteLine();

        <span class="rem">// Wait for Enter key to be pressed before shutting down.</span>
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Here we have a definition for a class type that supports a single method named Main(). By default,
    Visual Studio 2010 names the class defining Main() Program; however, you are free to change this if you
    so choose. Every executable C# application (console program, Windows desktop program, or Windows
    service) must contain a class defining a Main() method, which is used to signify the entry point of the
    application.</p>
    <p>Formally speaking, the class that defines the Main() method is termed the application object. While
    it is possible for a single executable application to have more than one application object (which can be
    useful when performing unit tests), you must inform the compiler which Main() method should be used
    as the entry point via the /main option of the command-line compiler, or via the Startup Object
    dropdown list box, located under the Application tab of the Visual Studio 2010 project properties editor.</p>
    <p>Note that the signature of Main() is adorned with the static keyword. For the time being, simply 
     understand that static members are scoped to the class level (rather than the object level) and can 
     thus be invoked without the need to first create a new class instance.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> C# is a case-sensitive programming language. Therefore, Main is not the same as main, and Readline is
    not the same as ReadLine. Be aware that all C# keywords are lowercase (e.g., public, lock, class, dynamic),
    while namespaces, types, and member names begin (by convention) with an initial capital letter and have
    capitalized the first letter of any embedded words (e.g., Console.WriteLine,
    System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox, System.Data.SqlClient). As a rule of thumb, whenever you
    receive a compiler error regarding &quot;undefined symbols&quot;, be sure to check your spelling!</p>
    <p>In addition to the static keyword, this Main() method has a single parameter, which happens to be
    an array of strings (string[] args). Although you are not currently bothering to process this array, this
    parameter may contain any number of incoming command-line arguments (you'll see how to access
    them momentarily). Finally, this Main() method has been set up with a void return value, meaning we do
    not explicitly define a return value using the return keyword before exiting the method scope.</p>
    <p>The logic of Program is within Main() itself. Here, you make use of the Console class, which is defined
    within the System namespace. Among its set of members is the static WriteLine() which, as you might
    assume, sends a text string and carriage return to the standard output. You also make a call to
    Console.ReadLine() to ensure the command prompt launched by the Visual Studio 2010 IDE remains
    visible during a debugging session until you press the Enter key.</p>
    <h2>Variations on the Main() Method</h2>
    <p>By default, Visual Studio 2010 will generate a Main() method that has a void return value and an array of
    string types as the single input parameter. This is not the only possible form of Main(), however. It is
    permissible to construct your application's entry point using any of the following signatures (assuming it
    is contained within a C# class or structure definition):</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// int return type, array of strings as the parameter.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Must return a value before exiting!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> 0;
}

<span class="rem">// No return type, no parameters.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
{
}

<span class="rem">// int return type, no parameters.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main()
{
    <span class="rem">// Must return a value before exiting!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> 0;
}</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> The Main() method may also be defined as public as opposed to private, which is assumed if you do not
    supply a specific access modifier. Visual Studio 2010 automatically defines a program's Main() method as
    implicitly private. Doing so ensures other applications cannot directly invoke the entry point of another.</p>
    <p>Obviously, your choice of how to construct Main() will be based on two questions. First, do you want
    to return a value to the system when Main() has completed and your program terminates? If so, you need
    to return an int data type rather than void. Second, do you need to process any user-supplied,
    command-line parameters? If so, they will be stored in the array of strings. Let's examine all of our
    options in more detail.</p>
    <h2>Specifying an Application Error Code</h2>
    <p>While a vast majority of your Main() methods will return void as the return value, the ability to return an
    int from Main() keeps C# consistent with other C-based languages. By convention, returning the value 0
    indicates the program has terminated successfully, while another value (such as -1) represents an error
    condition (be aware that the value 0 is automatically returned, even if you construct a Main() method
    prototyped to return void).</p>
    <p>On the Windows operating system, an application's return value is stored within a system
    environment variable named %ERRORLEVEL%. If you were to create an application that programmatically
    launches another executable (a topic examined in Chapter 16), you can obtain the value of %ERRORLEVEL%
    using the static System.Diagnostics.Process.ExitCode property.</p>
    <p>Given that an application's return value is passed to the system at the time the application
    terminates, it is obviously not possible for an application to obtain and display its final error code while
    running. However, to illustrate how to view this error level upon program termination, begin by
    updating the Main() method as follows:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Note we are now returning an int, rather than void.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Display a message and wait for Enter key to be pressed.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** My First C# App *****"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello World!"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.ReadLine();

    <span class="rem">// Return an arbitrary error code.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> -1;
}</pre>
    <p>Now let's capture the return value of Main() with the help of a batch file. Using Windows Explorer,
    navigate to the folder containing your compiled application (for example,
    C:\SimpleCSharpApp\bin\Debug). Add a new text file (named SimpleCSharpApp.bat) to the Debug folder
    that contains the following instructions (if you have not authored *.bat files before, don't concern
    yourself with the details; this is a test . . . this is only a test):</p>
<pre>@echo off

rem A batch file for SimpleCSharpApp.exe
rem which captures the app's return value.

SimpleCSharpApp
@if "%ERRORLEVEL%" == "0" goto success

:fail
	echo This application has failed!
	echo return value = %ERRORLEVEL%
	goto end
:success
	echo This application has succeeded!
	echo return value = %ERRORLEVEL%
	goto end
:end
	echo All Done.
</pre>
     <p>At this point, open a Visual Studio 2010 command prompt and navigate to the folder containing your
    executable and new *.bat file. Execute the batch logic by typing its name and pressing the Enter key. You
    should find the output shown in Figure 3-1, given that your Main() method is returning -1. Had the Main()
    method returned 0, you would see the message &quot;This application has succeeded!&quot; print to the console.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure03_01.png" alt="Figure 3-1" />
    <p><b>Figure 3-1</b> Capturing an application's return value via a batch file</p>
    <p>Again, a vast majority (if not all) of your C# applications will use void as the return value from
    Main(), which, as you recall, implicitly returns the error code of zero. To this end, the Main() methods
    used in this text (beyond the current example) will indeed return void (and the remaining projects will
    certainly not need to make use of batch files to capture return codes).</p>
    <h2>Processing Command-Line Arguments</h2>
    <p>Now that you better understand the return value of the Main() method, let's examine the incoming array
    of string data. Assume that you now wish to update your application to process any possible commandline
    parameters. One way to do so is using a C# for loop. (Note that C#'s iteration constructs will be
    examined in some detail near the end of this chapter.)</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Process any incoming args.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">for</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; args.Length; i++)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Arg: {0}"</span>, args[i]);

    Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> -1;
}</pre>
    <p>Here you are checking to see whether the array of strings contains some number of items using the
    Length property of System.Array. As you'll see in Chapter 4, all C# arrays actually alias the System.Array
    class and therefore share a common set of members. As you loop over each item in the array, its value is
    printed to the console window. Supplying the arguments at the command line is equally simple, as
    shown in Figure 3-2.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure03_02.png" alt="Figure 3-2" />
    <p><b>Figure 3-2</b> Supplying arguments at the command line</p>
    <p>As an alternative to the standard for loop, you may iterate over an incoming string array using the
    C# foreach keyword. Here is some sample usage.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">

<span class="rem">// Notice you have no need to check the size of the array when using "foreach".</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Process any incoming args using foreach.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span> arg <span class="kwrd">in</span> args)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Arg: {0}"</span>, arg);

    Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> -1;
}</pre>
    <p>Finally, you are also able to access command-line arguments using the static GetCommandLineArgs()
    method of the System.Environment type. The return value of this method is an array of strings. The first
    index identifies the name of the application itself, while the remaining elements in the array contain the
    individual command-line arguments. Note that when using this approach, it is no longer necessary to
    define Main() as taking a string array as the input parameter, although there is no harm in doing so.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Get arguments using System.Environment.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] theArgs =     Environment.GetCommandLineArgs();
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span> arg <span class="kwrd">in</span> theArgs)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Arg: {0}"</span>, arg);
    
    Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> -1;
}</pre>
    <p>Of course, it is up to you to determine which command-line arguments your program will respond
    to (if any) and how they must be formatted (such as with a - or / prefix). Here we simply passed in a
    series of options that were printed directly to the command prompt. Assume, however, you were
    creating a new video game and programmed your application to process an option named -godmode. If
    the user starts your application with the flag, you know he is, in fact, a cheater and you can take an
    appropriate course of action.</p>
    <h2>Specifying Command-Line Arguments with Visual Studio 2010</h2>
    <p>In the real world, an end user has the option of supplying command-line arguments when starting a
    program. However, during the development cycle, you may wish to specify possible command-line flags
    for testing purposes. To do so with Visual Studio 2010, double-click the Properties icon from Solution
    Explorer and select the Debug tab on the left side. From there, specify values using the command-line
    arguments text box (see Figure 3-3).</p>

    <p><b>Figure 3-3</b> Setting command arguments via Visual Studio 2010</p>
    <p>Once you have established such command-line arguments, they will automatically be passed to the
    Main() method when debugging or running your application within the Visual Studio IDE.</p>
