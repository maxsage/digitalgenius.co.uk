<h1>Understanding C# Events</h1>
  <p>Delegates are fairly interesting constructs in that they enable objects in memory to engage in a two-way
conversation. However, working with delegates in the raw can entail the creation of some boilerplate
code (defining the delegate, declaring necessary member variables, and creating custom registration and
unregistration methods to preserve encapsulation, etc.).</p>
<p>Moreover, when you use delegates in the raw as your application’s callback mechanism, if you do
not define a class’s delegate member variables as private, the caller will have direct access to the delegate
objects. In this case, the caller could reassign the variable to a new delegate object (effectively deleting
the current list of functions to call) and, worse yet, the caller would be able to directly invoke the
delegate’s invocation list. To illustrate this problem, consider the following reworking (and
simplification) of the previous CarDelegate example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarEngineHandler(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msgForCaller);

        <span class="rem">// Now a public member!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarEngineHandler listOfHandlers;

    <span class="rem">// Just fire out the Exploded notification.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Accelerate(<span class="kwrd">int</span> delta)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (listOfHandlers != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
            listOfHandlers(<span class="str">"Sorry, this car is dead..."</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that we no longer have private delegate member variables encapsulated with custom
registration methods. Because these members are indeed public, the caller can directly access the
listOfHandlers member variable and reassign this type to new CarEngineHandler objects and invoke the
delegate whenever it so chooses:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Agh! No Encapsulation! *****\n"</span>);
        <span class="rem">// Make a Car.</span>
        Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();

        <span class="rem">// We have direct access to the delegate!</span>
        myCar.listOfHandlers = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(CallWhenExploded);
        myCar.Accelerate(10);

        <span class="rem">// We can now assign to a whole new object...</span>
        <span class="rem">// confusing at best.</span>
        myCar.listOfHandlers = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(CallHereToo);
        myCar.Accelerate(10);

        <span class="rem">// The caller can also directly invoke the delegate!</span>
        myCar.listOfHandlers.Invoke(<span class="str">"hee, hee, hee..."</span>);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CallWhenExploded(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    { Console.WriteLine(msg); }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CallHereToo(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    { Console.WriteLine(msg); }
}</pre>
<p>Exposing public delegate members breaks encapsulation, which not only can lead to code that is
hard to maintain (and debug), but could also open your application to possible security risks! Here is the
output of the current example:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Agh! No Encapsulation! *****

Sorry, this car is dead...
Sorry, this car is dead...
hee, hee, hee...
</pre>
<p>Obviously, you would not want to give other applications the power to change what a delegate is
pointing to or to invoke the members without your permission.</p>
    <p><b>Source Code </b>The PublicDelegateProblem project is located under the Chapter 11 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>The C# event Keyword</h2>
  <p>As a shortcut, so you don’t have to build custom methods to add or remove methods to a delegate’s
invocation list, C# provides the event keyword. When the compiler processes the event keyword, you are
automatically provided with registration and unregistration methods as well as any necessary member
variables for your delegate types. These delegate member variables are always declared private, and
therefore they are not directly exposed from the object firing the event. To be sure, the event keyword is
little more than syntactic sugar in that it simply saves you some typing time.</p>
<p>Defining an event is a two-step process. First, you need to define a delegate type that will hold the
list of methods to be called when the event is fired. Next, you declare an event (using the C# event
keyword) in terms of the related delegate type.</p>
<p>To illustrate the event keyword, create a new Console Application named CarEvents. In this iteration
of the Car class, we will define two events named AboutToBlow and Exploded. These events are associated
to a single delegate type named CarEngineHandler. Here are the initial updates to the Car class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="rem">// This delegate works in conjunction with the</span>
    <span class="rem">// Car's events.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarEngineHandler(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg);

    <span class="rem">// This car can send these events.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">event</span> CarEngineHandler Exploded;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">event</span> CarEngineHandler AboutToBlow;
...
}</pre>
<p>Sending an event to the caller is as simple as specifying the event by name, along with any required
parameters as defined by the associated delegate. To ensure that the caller has indeed registered with
the event, you will want to check the event against a null value before invoking the delegate’s method
set. With these points in mind, here is the new iteration of the Car’s Accelerate() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Accelerate(<span class="kwrd">int</span> delta)
{
    <span class="rem">// If the car is dead, fire Exploded event.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (carIsDead)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (Exploded != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
            Exploded(<span class="str">"Sorry, this car is dead..."</span>);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
    {
        CurrentSpeed += delta;

        <span class="rem">// Almost dead?</span>
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (10 == MaxSpeed - CurrentSpeed
            &amp;&amp; AboutToBlow != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        {
            AboutToBlow(<span class="str">"Careful buddy! Gonna blow!"</span>);
        }

        <span class="rem">// Still OK!</span>
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (CurrentSpeed &gt;= MaxSpeed)
            carIsDead = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"CurrentSpeed = {0}"</span>, CurrentSpeed);
    }
}</pre>
<p>With this, you have configured the car to send two custom events without having to define custom
registration functions or declare delegate member variables. You will see the usage of this new
automobile in just a moment, but first, let’s check the event architecture in a bit more detail.</p>
<h2>Events under the Hood</h2>
  <p>A C# event actually expands into two hidden methods, one having an add_ prefix, the other having a
remove_ prefix. Each prefix is followed by the name of the C# event. For example, the Exploded event
results in two hidden methods named add_Exploded() and remove_Exploded(). If you were to check out
the CIL instructions behind add_AboutToBlow(), you would find a call to Delegate.Combine() method.
Consider the partial CIL code:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig specialname instance void
add_AboutToBlow(class CarEvents.Car/CarEngineHandler 'value') cil managed
{
...
	call class [mscorlib]System.Delegate
	[mscorlib]System.Delegate::Combine(
		class [mscorlib]System.Delegate, class [mscorlib]System.Delegate)
...
}
</pre>
<p>As you would expect, remove_AboutToBlow() will call Delegate.Remove() on your behalf:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig specialname instance void
	remove_AboutToBlow(class CarEvents.Car/CarEngineHandler 'value')
	cil managed synchronized
{
...
	call class [mscorlib]System.Delegate
		[mscorlib]System.Delegate::Remove(
			class [mscorlib]System.Delegate, class [mscorlib]System.Delegate)
...
}</pre>
<p>Finally, the CIL code representing the event itself makes use of the .addon and .removeon directives
to map the names of the correct add_XXX() and remove_XXX() methods to invoke:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.event CarEvents.Car/EngineHandler AboutToBlow
{
	.addon void CarEvents.Car::add_AboutToBlow
		(class CarEvents.Car/CarEngineHandler)

	.removeon void CarEvents.Car::remove_AboutToBlow
		(class CarEvents.Car/CarEngineHandler)
}

</pre>
<p>Now that you understand how to build a class that can send C# events (and are aware that events
are little more than a typing time-saver), the next big question is how to listen to the incoming events on
the caller’s side.</p>
<h2>Listening to Incoming Events</h2>
  <p>C# events also simplify the act of registering the caller-side event handlers. Rather than having to specify
custom helper methods, the caller simply makes use of the += and -= operators directly (which triggers
the correct add_XXX() or remove_XXX() method in the background). When you wish to register with an
event, follow the pattern shown here:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// NameOfObject.NameOfEvent += new RelatedDelegate(functionToCall);</span>
<span class="rem">//</span>
Car.EngineHandler d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEventHandler(CarExplodedEventHandler)
myCar.Exploded += d;</pre>
<p>When you wish to detach from a source of events, use the -= operator, using the following pattern</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// NameOfObject.NameOfEvent -= new RelatedDelegate(functionToCall);</span>
<span class="rem">//</span>
myCar.Exploded -= d;</pre>
<p>Given these very predictable patterns, here is the refactored Main() method, now using the C# event
registration syntax:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Events *****\n"</span>);
        Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"SlugBug"</span>, 100, 10);

        <span class="rem">// Register event handlers.</span>
        c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(CarIsAlmostDoomed);
        c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(CarAboutToBlow);

        Car.CarEngineHandler d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car.CarEngineHandler(CarExploded);
        c1.Exploded += d;

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Speeding up *****"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
            c1.Accelerate(20);

        <span class="rem">// Remove CarExploded method</span>
        <span class="rem">// from invocation list.</span>
        c1.Exploded -= d;

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\n***** Speeding up *****"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
            c1.Accelerate(20);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarAboutToBlow(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    { Console.WriteLine(msg); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarIsAlmostDoomed(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    { Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; Critical Message from Car: {0}"</span>, msg); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarExploded(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    { Console.WriteLine(msg); }
}</pre>
    <p>To even further simplify event registration, you can use method group conversion. Consider the
following iteration of Main():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Events *****\n"</span>);
    Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"SlugBug"</span>, 100, 10);

    <span class="rem">// Register event handlers.</span>
    c1.AboutToBlow += CarIsAlmostDoomed;
    c1.AboutToBlow += CarAboutToBlow;
    c1.Exploded += CarExploded;

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Speeding up *****"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
        c1.Accelerate(20);

        c1.Exploded -= CarExploded;

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\n***** Speeding up *****"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
        c1.Accelerate(20);
    
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Simplifying Event Registration Using Visual Studio 2010</h2>
<p>Visual Studio 2010 offers assistance with the process of registering event handlers. When you apply the
+= syntax during event registration, you will find an IntelliSense window displayed, inviting you to hit the
Tab key to autocomplete the associated delegate instance (see Figure 11-2)</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure11_02.png" alt="Figure 11-2" />
<p><b>Figure 11-2. </b>Delegate selection IntelliSense</p>
<p>After you hit the Tab key, you are invited to enter the name of the event handler to be generated (or
simply accept the default name) as shown in Figure 11-3.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure11_03.png" alt="Figure 11-3" />
<p><b>Figure 11-3. </b>Delegate target format IntelliSense</p>
 <p>When you hit the Tab key again, you will be provided with stub code in the correct format of the
delegate target (note that this method has been declared static due to the fact that the event was
registered within the static Main() method):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> newCar_AboutToBlow(<span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
{
    <span class="rem">// Add your code!</span>
}</pre>
<p>IntelliSense is available to all .NET events in the base class libraries. This IDE feature is a massive
time-saver, given that it saves you from having to search the .NET help system to figure out both the
correct delegate to use with a particular event and the format of the delegate target method.</p>
<p><b>Source Code</b> The CarEvents project is located under the Chapter 11 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>Creating Custom Event Arguments</h2>
<p>Truth be told, there is one final enhancement we could make to the current iteration of the Car class that
mirrors Microsoft’s recommended event pattern. As you begin to explore the events sent by a given type
in the base class libraries, you will find that the first parameter of the underlying delegate is a
System.Object, while the second parameter is a descendent of System.EventArgs.</p>
<p>The System.Object argument represents a reference to the object that sent the event (such as the
Car), while the second parameter represents information regarding the event at hand. The
System.EventArgs base class represents an event that is not sending any custom information:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> EventArgs
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> System.EventArgs Empty;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> EventArgs();
}</pre>
<p>For simple events, you can pass an instance of EventArgs directly. However, when you wish to pass
along custom data, you should build a suitable class deriving from EventArgs. For our example, assume
you have a class named CarEventArgs, which maintains a string representing the message sent to the
receiver:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> msg;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarEventArgs(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message)
    {
        msg = message;
    }
}</pre>
<p>With this, you would now update the CarEngineHandler delegate type definition as follows (the
events would be unchanged):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarEngineHandler(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e);
...
}</pre>
<p>Here, when firing the events from within the Accelerate() method, you would now need to supply a
reference to the current Car (via the this keyword) and an instance of the CarEventArgs type. For
example, consider the following partial update:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Accelerate(<span class="kwrd">int</span> delta)
{
    <span class="rem">// If the car is dead, fire Exploded event.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (carIsDead)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (Exploded != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
            Exploded(<span class="kwrd">this</span>, <span class="kwrd">new</span> CarEventArgs(<span class="str">"Sorry, this car is dead..."</span>));
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>On the caller’s side, all you would need to do is update your event handlers to receive the incoming
parameters and obtain the message via the read-only field. For example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarAboutToBlow(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} says: {1}"</span>, sender, e.msg);
}</pre>
<p>If the receiver wishes to interact with the object that sent the event, you can explicitly cast the
System.Object. From this reference, you can make use of any public member of the object that sent the
event notification:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CarAboutToBlow(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Just to be safe, perform a</span>
    <span class="rem">// runtime check before casting.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (sender <span class="kwrd">is</span> Car)
    {
        Car c = (Car)sender;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Critical Message from {0}: {1}"</span>, c.PetName, e.msg);
    }
}</pre>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The PrimAndProperCarEvents project is located under the Chapter 11 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>The Generic EventHandler&lt;T&gt; Delegate</h2>
  <p>Given that so many custom delegates take an object as the first parameter and an EventArgs descendent
as the second, you could further streamline the previous example by using the generic EventHandler&lt;T&gt;
type, where T is your custom EventArgs type. Consider the following update to the Car type (notice how
we no longer need to define a custom delegate type at all):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">event</span> EventHandler&lt;CarEventArgs&gt; Exploded;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">event</span> EventHandler&lt;CarEventArgs&gt; AboutToBlow;
...
}</pre>
<p>The Main() method could then use EventHandler&lt;CarEventArgs&gt; anywhere we previously specified
CarEventHandler (or, once again, use method group conversion):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Prim and Proper Events *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make a car as usual.</span>
    Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"SlugBug"</span>, 100, 10);

    <span class="rem">// Register event handlers.</span>
    c1.AboutToBlow += CarIsAlmostDoomed;
    c1.AboutToBlow += CarAboutToBlow;

    EventHandler&lt;CarEventArgs&gt; d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> EventHandler&lt;CarEventArgs&gt;(CarExploded);
    c1.Exploded += d;
...
}</pre>
<p>Great! At this point, you have seen the core aspects of working with delegates and events in the C#
language. While you could use this information for just about all of your callback needs, we will wrap up
this chapter with a look at some final simplifications, specifically anonymous methods and lambda
expressions.</p>
