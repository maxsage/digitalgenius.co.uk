<h1>Understanding Web Applications and Web Servers</h1>
    <p>web application can be understood as a collection of files (e.g., *.htm, *.aspx, image files, XML-based
file data) and related components (such as a .NET code library) stored within a particular set of
directories on a web server. As shown in Chapter 34, ASP.NET web applications have a specific life cycle
and provide numerous events (such as initial startup or final shutdown) that you can hook into to
perform specialized processing during your website’s operation.</p>
<p>A web server is a software product in charge of hosting your web applications; it typically provides a
number of related services such as integrated security, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) support, mail
exchange services, and so forth. Internet Information Services (IIS) is the Microsoft enterprise-level web
server product, and it offers intrinsic support for classic ASP as well as ASP.NET web applications.</p>
<p>Assuming you have IIS properly installed on your workstation, you can interact with IIS from the
Administrative Tools folder (located in the Control Panel folder) by double-clicking the Internet
Information Services applet. Figure 32-2 shows the Default Web Site node of IIS 7 where a majority of the
configuration details occur (if you are running earlier versions of IIS, your UI will look different).</p>

<h2>The Role of IIS Virtual Directories</h2>
<p>A single IIS installation is able to host numerous web applications, each of which resides in a virtual
directory. Each virtual directory is mapped to a physical directory on the machine’s hard drive. For
example, if you create a new virtual directory named CarsAreUs, the outside world can navigate to this
site using a URL such as http://www.MyDomain.com/CarsAreUs (assuming your site’s IP address has been
registered with a DNS of www.MyDomain.com). Under the hood, this virtual directory maps to a physical
root directory on the web server which contains the content of the CarsAreUs web application.</p>
<p>As you will see later in this chapter, when you create ASP.NET web applications using Visual Studio
2010, you have the option of having the IDE generate a new virtual directory for the current website
automatically. However, if required, you are certainly able to manually create a virtual directory by hand by
right-clicking the Default Web Site node of IIS and selecting Add Virtual Directory from the context menu.</p>
<h2>The ASP.NET Development Web Server</h2>
<p>Prior to .NET 2.0, ASP.NET developers were required to make use of IIS virtual directories during the
development and testing of their web applications. In many cases, this tight dependency on IIS made
team development more complex than necessary, not to mention that many network administrators
frowned upon installing IIS on every developer’s machine.</p>
<p>Happily, there is the option of a lightweight web server named the ASP.NET Development Web
Server. This utility allows developers to host an ASP.NET web application outside the bounds of IIS.
Using this tool, you can build and test your web pages from any folder on your machine. This is quite
helpful for team development scenarios and for building ASP.NET web applications on versions of
Windows that do not support IIS installations.</p>
<p>Most of the examples in this book will make use of the ASP.NET Development Web Server (via the
correct Visual Studio 2010 project option) rather than hosting web content under an IIS virtual directory.
While this approach can simplify the development of your web application, be aware that this web
server is not intended to host production-level web applications. It is intended purely for development
and testing purposes. Once a web application is ready for prime time, your site will need to be copied to
an IIS virtual directory.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The Mono project (see Appendix B) provides a free ASP.NET plug-in for the Apache web server. This
makes it possible to build and host ASP.NET web applications on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.
