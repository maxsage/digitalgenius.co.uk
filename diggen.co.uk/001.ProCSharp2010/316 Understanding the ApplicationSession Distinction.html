<h1>Understanding the Application/Session Distinction</h1>
<p>Under ASP.NET, application state is maintained by an instance of the HttpApplicationState type. This
class enables you to share global information across all users (and all pages) using your ASP.NET
application. Not only can application data be shared by all users on your site, but also if the value of an
application-level data point changes, the new value is seen by all users on their next postback.</p>
<p>On the other hand, session state is used to remember information for a specific user (again, such as
items in a shopping cart). Physically, a user’s session state is represented by the HttpSessionState class
type. When a new user reaches an ASP.NET web application, the runtime will automatically assign that
user a new session ID, which by default will expire after 20 minutes of inactivity. Thus, if 20,000 users are
logged on to your site, you have 20,000 distinct HttpSessionState objects, each of which is automatically
assigned a unique session ID. The relationship between a web application and web sessions is shown in
Figure 34-4.</p>
<p>If you have ever worked with classic ASP, you might recall that application- and session-state data is
represented using distinct COM objects (e.g., Application and Session). Under ASP.NET, Page-derived
types as well as the HttpApplication type use identically named properties (i.e., Application and
Session), which expose the underlying HttpApplicationState and HttpSessionState types.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Application-Level State Data</h2>
<p>The HttpApplicationState type enables developers to share global information across multiple users in
an ASP.NET application. Table 34-3 describes some core members of this type.</p> 
<p><b>Table 34-3.</b> Members of the HttpApplicationState Type</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Members
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Add()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method allows you to add a new name/value pair to the
HttpApplicationState object. Do note that this method is typically not
used in favor of the indexer of the HttpApplicationState class.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AllKeys
   </td>
   <td>
    This property returns an array of string objects that represent all the
names in the HttpApplicationState type.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Clear()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method deletes all items in the HttpApplicationState object. This is
functionally equivalent to the RemoveAll() method.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Count
   </td>
   <td>
    This property gets the number of item objects in the HttpApplicationState
type.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Lock(), UnLock()
   </td>
   <td>
    These two methods are used when you wish to alter a set of application
variables in a thread-safe manner.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    RemoveAll(), Remove(),
RemoveAt()
   </td>
   <td>
    These methods remove a specific item (by string name) within the
HttpApplicationState object. RemoveAt() removes the item via a numerical
indexer.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>  
<p>To illustrate working with application state, create a new Empty Web Site project named AppState
(and insert a new Web Form). Next, insert a new Global.asax file. When you create data members that
can be shared among all users, you need to establish a set of name/value pairs. In most cases, the most
natural place to do so is within the Application_Start() event handler in Global.asax.cs, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">void</span> Application_Start(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Set up some application variables.</span>
    Application[<span class="str">"SalesPersonOfTheMonth"</span>] = <span class="str">"Chucky"</span>;
    Application[<span class="str">"CurrentCarOnSale"</span>] = <span class="str">"Colt"</span>;
    Application[<span class="str">"MostPopularColorOnLot"</span>] = <span class="str">"Black"</span>;
}</pre>
<p>During the lifetime of your web application (which is to say, until the web application is manually
shut down or until the final user times out), any user on any page may access these values as necessary.
Assume you have a page that will display the current discount car within a Label via a button Click event
handler:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnShowCarOnSale_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs arg)
{
    lblCurrCarOnSale.Text = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Sale on {0}'s today!"</span>,
        (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)Application[<span class="str">"CurrentCarOnSale"</span>]);
}</pre>
<p>As with the ViewState property, notice how you should cast the value returned from the
HttpApplicationState object into the correct underlying type because the Application property operates
on general System.Object types.</p>
<p>Now, given that the Application property can hold any type, it should stand to reason that you can
place custom types (or any .NET object) within your site’s application state. Assume you’d rather
maintain the three current application variables within a strongly typed class named CarLotInfo:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarLotInfo
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CarLotInfo(<span class="kwrd">string</span> s, <span class="kwrd">string</span> c, <span class="kwrd">string</span> m)
    {
        salesPersonOfTheMonth = s;
        currentCarOnSale = c;
        mostPopularColorOnLot = m;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Public for easy access, could also make use of automatic</span>
    <span class="rem">// property syntax.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> salesPersonOfTheMonth;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> currentCarOnSale;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> mostPopularColorOnLot;
}</pre>
    <p>With this helper class in place, you could modify the Application_Start() event handler as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">void</span> Application_Start(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Place a custom object in the application data sector.</span>
    Application[<span class="str">"CarSiteInfo"</span>] =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> CarLotInfo(<span class="str">"Chucky"</span>, <span class="str">"Colt"</span>, <span class="str">"Black"</span>);
}</pre>
    <p>and then access the information using the public field data within a server-side Click event handler for a
Button control named btnShowAppVariables:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnShowAppVariables_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    CarLotInfo appVars =
        ((CarLotInfo)Application[<span class="str">"CarSiteInfo"</span>]);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> appState =
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Car on sale: {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        appVars.currentCarOnSale);
    appState +=
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Most popular color: {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        appVars.mostPopularColorOnLot);
    appState +=
        <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"&lt;li&gt;Big shot SalesPerson: {0}&lt;/li&gt;"</span>,
        appVars.salesPersonOfTheMonth);
    lblAppVariables.Text = appState;
}</pre>
<p>Given that the current car-on-sale data is now exposed from a custom class type, your
btnShowCarOnSale Click event handler would also need to be updated, like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnShowCarOnSale_Click1(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    lblCurrCarOnSale.Text = String.Format(<span class="str">"Sale on {0}'s today!"</span>,
        ((CarLotInfo)Application[<span class="str">"CarSiteInfo"</span>]).currentCarOnSale);
}</pre>
    <h2>Modifying Application Data</h2>
<p>You may programmatically update or delete any or all application-wide data items using members of the
HttpApplicationState type during the execution of your web application. For example, to delete a
specific item, simply call the Remove() method. If you wish to destroy all application-level data, call
RemoveAll():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CleanAppData()
{
    <span class="rem">// Remove a single item via string name.</span>
    Application.Remove(<span class="str">"SomeItemIDontNeed"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Destroy all application data!</span>
    Application.RemoveAll();
}</pre>
<p>If you want to change the value of an existing application-level data item, you need only make a new
assignment to the data item in question. Assume your page now has a Button that allows your user to
change the current hotshot salesperson by reading in a value from a TextBox named txtNewSP. The Click
event handler is as you’d expect:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSetNewSP_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Set the new Salesperson.</span>
    ((CarLotInfo)Application[<span class="str">"CarSiteInfo"</span>]).salesPersonOfTheMonth
        = txtNewSP.Text;
}</pre>
<p>If you run the web application, you’ll find that the application-level data item has been updated.
Furthermore, given that application variables are accessible by any user on any page in the Web
application, if you launched three or four instances of your web browser, you’d find that if one instance
changes the current hotshot salesperson, each of the other browsers displays the new value on postback.
Figure 34-5 shows some possible output.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure34_05.png" alt="Figure 34-5" />
<p><b>Figure 34-5</b> Displaying application data</p>
<p>Understand that if you have a situation where a set of application-level variables must be updated
as a unit, you risk the possibility of data corruption (since it is technically possible that an applicationlevel
data point may be changed while another user is attempting to access it!). You could take the long
road and manually lock down the logic using threading primitives of the System.Threading namespace,
but the HttpApplicationState type has two methods, Lock() and Unlock(), that automatically ensure
thread safety:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Safely access related application data.</span>
Application.Lock();
Application[<span class="str">"SalesPersonOfTheMonth"</span>] = <span class="str">"Maxine"</span>;
Application[<span class="str">"CurrentBonusedEmployee"</span>] = Application[<span class="str">"SalesPersonOfTheMonth"</span>];
Application.UnLock();</pre>
<h2>Handling Web Application Shutdown</h2>
<p>The HttpApplicationState type is designed to maintain the values of the items it contains until one of
two situations occurs: the last user on your site times out (or manually logs out) or someone manually
shuts down the web site via IIS. In either case, the Application_End() method of the HttpApplicationderived
type will automatically be called. Within this event handler, you are able to perform whatever
sort of cleanup is necessary:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">void</span> Application_End(Object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Write current application variables</span>
    <span class="rem">// to a database or whatever else you need to do...</span>
}</pre>
