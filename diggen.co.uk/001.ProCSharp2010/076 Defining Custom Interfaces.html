<h1>Defining Custom Interfaces</h1>
  <p>Now that you better understand the overall role of interface types, let’s see an example of defining and
implementing custom interfaces. To begin, create a brand-new Console Application named
CustomInterface. Using the Project ? Add Existing Item menu option, insert the file(s) containing your
shape type definitions (Shapes.cs in the book’s solution code) created back in Chapter 6 during the
Shapes example. Once you have done so, rename the namespace that defines your shape-centric types to
CustomInterface (simply to avoid having to import namespace definitions in your new project):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> CustomInterface
{
    <span class="rem">// Your shape types defined here...</span>
}</pre>
<p>Now, insert a new interface into your project named IPointy using the Project ? Add New Item
menu option, as shown in Figure 9-1.</p>

<p><b>Figure 9-1. </b>Interfaces, like classes, can be defined in any *.cs file</p>
<p>At a syntactic level, an interface is defined using the C# interface keyword. Unlike a class, interfaces
never specify a base class (not even System.Object; however, as you will see later in this chapter, an
interface can specify base interfaces). Moreover, the members of an interface never specify an access
modifier (as all interface members are implicitly public and abstract). To get the ball rolling, here is a
custom interface defined in C#:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This interface defines the behavior of "having points."</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IPointy
{
    <span class="rem">// Implicitly public and abstract.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">byte</span> GetNumberOfPoints();
}</pre>
    <p>Remember that when you define interface members, you do not define an implementation scope
for the member in question. Interfaces are pure protocol, and therefore never define an implementation
(that is up to the supporting class or structure). Therefore, the following version of IPointy would result
in various compiler errors:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Ack! Errors abound!
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IPointy
{
    // <span class="kwrd">Error</span>! Interfaces cannot have fields!
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> int numbOfPoints;

    // <span class="kwrd">Error</span>! Interfaces <span class="kwrd">do</span> <span class="kwrd">not</span> have constructors!
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> IPointy() { numbOfPoints = 0;};

    // <span class="kwrd">Error</span>! Interfaces don<span class="rem">'t provide an implementation of members!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">byte</span> GetNumberOfPoints() { <span class="kwrd">return</span> numbOfPoints; }
}</pre>
<p>In any case, this initial IPointy interface defines a single method. However, .NET interface types are
also able to define any number of property prototypes. For example, you could create the IPointy
interface to use a read-only property rather than a traditional accessor method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// The pointy behavior <span class="kwrd">as</span> a read-only <span class="kwrd">property</span>.
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IPointy
{
    // A read-write <span class="kwrd">property</span> <span class="kwrd">in</span> an <span class="kwrd">interface</span> would look <span class="kwrd">like</span>:
    // retType PropName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    // <span class="kwrd">while</span> a write-only <span class="kwrd">property</span> <span class="kwrd">in</span> an <span class="kwrd">interface</span> would be:
    // retType PropName { <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="kwrd">byte</span> Points { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> Interface types can also contain event (see Chapter 11) and indexer (see Chapter 12) definitions</p>
<p>Interface types are quite useless on their own, as they are nothing more than a named collection of
abstract members. For example, you can’t allocate interface types as you would a class or structure:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Ack! Illegal <span class="kwrd">to</span> allocate <span class="kwrd">interface</span> types.
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    IPointy p = <span class="kwrd">new</span> IPointy(); // Compiler <span class="kwrd">error</span>!
}</pre>
<p>Interfaces do not bring much to the table until they are implemented by a class or structure. Here,
IPointy is an interface that expresses the behavior of “having points.” The idea is simple: some classes in
the shapes hierarchy have points (such as the Hexagon), while others (such as the Circle) do not.</p>
