<h1>Configuring Objects for Serialization</h1>
    <p>To make an object available to .NET serialization services, all you need to do is decorate each related
class (or structure) with the [Serializable] attribute. If you determine that a given type has some
member data that should not (or perhaps cannot) participate in the serialization scheme, you can mark
such fields with the [NonSerialized] attribute. This can be helpful if you wish to reduce the size of the
persisted data, and you have member variables in a serializable class that do not need to be remembered
(e.g., fixed values, random -values, and transient data).</p>
<h2>Defining Serializable Types</h2>
<p>To get the ball rolling, create a new Console Application named SimpleSerialize. Insert a new class
named Radio, which has been marked [Serializable], excluding a single member variable (radioID)
that has been marked [NonSerialized] and will therefore not be persisted into the specified data stream:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Radio
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> hasTweeters;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> hasSubWoofers;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span>[] stationPresets;

    [NonSerialized]
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> radioID = <span class="str">"XF-552RR6"</span>;
}</pre>
<p>Next, insert two additional class types to represent the JamesBondCar and Car base classes, both of
which are also marked [Serializable] and define the following pieces of field data:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Radio theRadio = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Radio();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> isHatchBack;
}

[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> JamesBondCar : Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> canFly;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> canSubmerge;
}</pre>
<p>Be aware that you cannot inherit the [Serializable] attribute from a parent class. Therefore, if you
derive a class from a type marked [Serializable], the child class must be marked [Serializable] as
well, or it cannot be persisted. In fact, all objects in an object graph must be marked with the
[Serializable] attribute. If you attempt to serialize a nonserializable object using the BinaryFormatter
or SoapFormatter, you will receive a SerializationException at runtime.</p>
<h2>Public Fields, Private Fields, and Public Properties</h2>
<p>Notice that in each of these classes, you define the field data as public; this helps keep the example
simple. Of course, private data exposed using public properties would be preferable from an OO point of
view. Also, for the sake of simplicity, this example does not define any custom constructors on these
types; therefore, all unassigned field data will receive the expected default values.</p>
<p>OO design principles aside, you might wonder how the various formatters expect a type’s field data
to be defined in order to be serialized into a stream. The answer is that it depends. If you persist an
object’s state using the BinaryFormatter or SoapFormatter, it makes absolutely no difference. These types
are programmed to serialize all serializable fields of a type, regardless of whether they are public fields,
private fields, or private fields exposed through public properties. Recall, however, that if you have
points of data that you do not want to be persisted into the object graph, you can selectively mark public
or private fields as [NonSerialized], as you do with the string field of the Radio type.</p>
<p>The situation is quite different if you use the XmlSerializer type, however. This type will only
serialize public data fields or private data exposed by public properties. Private data not exposed from
properties will be ignored. For example, consider the following serializable Person type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Person
{
    <span class="rem">// A public field.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> isAlive = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;

    <span class="rem">// A private field.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> personAge = 21;

    <span class="rem">// Public property/private data.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> fName = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Empty;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> FirstName
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> fName; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { fName = value; }
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you processed the preceding with BinaryFormatter or SoapFormatter, you would find that the
isAlive, personAge, and fName fields are saved into the selected stream. However, the XmlSerializer
would not save the value of personAge because this piece of private data is not encapsulated by a public
type property. If you wished to persist the age of the person with the XmlSerializer, you would need to
define the field publicly or encapsulate the private member using a public property.</p>
