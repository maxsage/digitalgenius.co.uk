    <h1>Working with String Data</h1>
     <p>System.String provides a number of methods you would expect from such a utility class, including
    methods that return the length of the character data, find substrings within the current string, and
    convert to and from uppercase/lowercase. Table 3-5 lists some (but by no means all) of the interesting
    members.</p>

    <h2>Basic String Manipulation</h2>
    <p>Working with the members of System.String is as you would expect. Simply declare a string variable
    and make use of the provided functionality via the dot operator. Be aware that a few of the members of
    System.String are static members and are, therefore, called at the class (rather than the object) level.
    Assume you have created a new Console Application project named FunWithStrings. Author the
    following method, which should be called from within Main():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> BasicStringFunctionality()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; Basic String functionality:"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> firstName = <span class="str">"Freddy"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Value of firstName: {0}"</span>, firstName);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"firstName has {0} characters."</span>, firstName.Length);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"firstName in uppercase: {0}"</span>, firstName.ToUpper());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"firstName in lowercase: {0}"</span>, firstName.ToLower());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"firstName contains the letter y?: {0}"</span>,
        firstName.Contains(<span class="str">"y"</span>));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"firstName after replace: {0}"</span>, firstName.Replace(<span class="str">"dy"</span>, <span class="str">""</span>));
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Not too much to say here, as this method simply invokes various members, such as ToUpper() and
    Contains(), on a local string variable to yield various formats and transformations. Figure 3-9 shows the
    initial output.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure03_09.png" alt="Figure 3-9" />
    <p><b>Figure 3-9</b> Basic string manipulation</p>
    <p>While this output may not seem too surprising, the output seen via calling the Replace() method is a
    tad bit misleading. In reality, the firstName variable has not changed at all; rather, we receive back a new
    string in a modified format. We will revisit the immutable nature of strings in just a few moments.</p>
    <h2>String Concatenation</h2>
    <p>string variables can be connected together to build larger strings via the C# + operator. As you may
    know, this technique is formally termed string concatenation. Consider the following new helper
    function:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StringConcatenation()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; String concatenation:"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s1 = <span class="str">"Programming the "</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s2 = <span class="str">"PsychoDrill (PTP)"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s3 = s1 + s2;
    Console.WriteLine(s3);
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
    <p>You may be interested to know that the C# + symbol is processed by the compiler to emit a call to
    the static String.Concat() method. In fact, if you were to compile the previous code and open the
    assembly within ildasm.exe (see Chapter 1), you would find the common intermediate language (CIL)
    code shown in Figure 3-10.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure03_10.png" alt="Figure 3-10" />
    <p><b>Figure 3-10</b>The C# + operator results in a call to String.Concat()</p>
    <p>Given this, it is possible to perform string concatenation by calling String.Concat() directly
    (although you really have not gained anything by doing soï¿½in fact, you have incurred additional
    keystrokes!).</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StringConcatenation()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; String concatenation:"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s1 = <span class="str">"Programming the "</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s2 = <span class="str">"PsychoDrill (PTP)"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s3 = String.Concat(s1, s2);
    Console.WriteLine(s3);
    Console.WriteLine();
}
</pre>
    <h2>Escape Characters</h2>
    <p>As in other C-based languages, C# string literals may contain various escape characters, which qualify
    how the character data should be printed to the output stream. Each escape character begins with a
    backslash, followed by a specific token. In case you are a bit rusty on the meanings behind these escape
    characters, Table 3-6 lists the more common options.</p>
    <p><b>Table 3-6.</b> String Literal Escape Characters</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>
                Character
            </th>
            <th>
                Meaning in Life
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \'
            </td>
            <td>
                Inserts a single quote into a string literal.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \"
            </td>
            <td>
                Inserts a double quote into a string literal.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \\
            </td>
            <td>
                Inserts a backslash into a string literal. This can be quite helpful when defining
                file or network paths.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \a
            </td>
            <td>
                Triggers a system alert (beep). For console programs, this can be an audio clue
                to the user.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \n
            </td>
            <td>
                Inserts a new line (on Windows platforms).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \r
            </td>
            <td>
                Inserts a carriage return.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                \t
            </td>
            <td>
                Inserts a horizontal tab into the string literal.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>For example, to print a string that contains a tab between each word, you can make use of the \t
    escape character. Or assume you wish to create a string literal that contains quotation marks, another
    that defines a directory path, and a final string literal that inserts three blank lines after printing the
    character data. To do so without compiler errors, you would need to make use of the \", \\, and \n
    escape characters. Also, to annoy any person within a 10-foot radius from you, notice that I have
    embedded an alarm within each string literal (to trigger a beep). Consider the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> EscapeChars()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; Escape characters:\a"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> strWithTabs = <span class="str">"Model\tColor\tSpeed\tPet Name\a "</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(strWithTabs);

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Everyone loves \"Hello World\"\a "</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"C:\\MyApp\\bin\\Debug\a "</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Adds a total of 4 blank lines (then beep again!).</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"All finished.\n\n\n\a "</span>);
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
    <h2>Defining Verbatim Strings</h2>
    <p>When you prefix a string literal with the @ symbol, you have created what is termed a verbatim string.
    Using verbatim strings, you disable the processing of a literal's escape characters and print out a string
    as is. This can be most useful when working with strings representing directory and network paths.
    Therefore, rather than making use of \\ escape characters, you can simply write the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The following string is printed verbatim</span>
<span class="rem">// thus, all escape characters are displayed.</span>
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">@"C:\MyApp\bin\Debug"</span>);</pre>
    <p>Also note that verbatim strings can be used to preserve white space for strings that flow over
    multiple lines.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// White space is preserved with verbatim strings.</span>
<span class="kwrd">string</span> myLongString = <span class="str">@"This is a very
    very
        very
long string"</span>;
Console.WriteLine(myLongString);    </pre>
    <p>Using verbatim strings, you can also directly insert a double quote into a literal string by doubling
    the " token.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">@"Cerebus said "</span><span class="str">"Darrr! Pret-ty sun-sets"</span><span class="str">""</span>);</pre>
    <h2>Strings and Equality</h2>
    <p>As fully explained in Chapter 4, a reference type is an object allocated on the garbage-collected managed
    heap. By default, when you perform a test for equality on reference types (via the C# == and !=
    operators), you will be returned true if the references are pointing to the same object in memory.
    However, even though the string data type is indeed a reference type, the equality operators have been
    redefined to compare the values of string objects, not the object in memory to which they refer.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StringEquality()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; String equality:"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s1 = <span class="str">"Hello!"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s2 = <span class="str">"Yo!"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 = {0}"</span>, s1);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s2 = {0}"</span>, s2);
    Console.WriteLine();

    <span class="rem">// Test these strings for equality.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 == s2: {0}"</span>, s1 == s2);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 == Hello!: {0}"</span>, s1 == <span class="str">"Hello!"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 == HELLO!: {0}"</span>, s1 == <span class="str">"HELLO!"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 == hello!: {0}"</span>, s1 == <span class="str">"hello!"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1.Equals(s2): {0}"</span>, s1.Equals(s2));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Yo.Equals(s2): {0}"</span>, <span class="str">"Yo!"</span>.Equals(s2));
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
    <p>The C# equality operators perform a case-sensitive, character-by-character equality test on string
    objects. Therefore, "Hello!" is not equal to "HELLO!", which is different from "hello!". Also, keeping the
    connection between string and System.String in mind, notice that we are able to test for equality using
    the Equals() method of String as well as the baked-in equality operators. Finally, given that every string
    literal (such as "Yo") is a valid System.String instance, we are able to access string-centric functionality
    from a fixed sequence of characters.</p>
    <h2>Strings Are Immutable</h2>
    <p>One of the interesting aspects of System.String is that once you assign a string object with its initial
    value, the character data cannot be changed. At first glance, this might seem like a flat-out lie, given that
    we are always reassigning strings to new values and because the System.String type defines a number of
    methods that appear to modify the character data in one way or another (such as uppercasing and
    lowercasing). However, if you look more closely at what is happening behind the scenes, you will notice
    the methods of the string type are, in fact, returning you a brand-new string object in a modified
    format.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StringsAreImmutable()
{
    <span class="rem">// Set initial string value.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s1 = <span class="str">"This is my string."</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 = {0}"</span>, s1);

    <span class="rem">// Uppercase s1?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> upperString = s1.ToUpper();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"upperString = {0}"</span>, upperString);

    <span class="rem">// Nope! s1 is in the same format!</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"s1 = {0}"</span>, s1);
}    
</pre>
    <p>If you examine the relevant output in Figure 3-11, you can verify that the original string object (s1)
    is not uppercased when calling ToUpper(), rather you are returned a copy of the string in a modified
    format.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure03_11.png" alt="Figure 3-11" />
    <p><b>Figure 3-11</b> Strings are immutable</p>
    <p>The same law of immutability holds true when you use the C# assignment operator. To illustrate,
    comment out (or delete) any existing code within StringsAreImmutable() (to decrease the amount of
    generated CIL code) and add the following code statements:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StringAreImmutable()
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s2 = <span class="str">"My other string"</span>;
    s2 = <span class="str">"New string value"</span>;
}</pre>
    <p>Now, compile your application and load the assembly into ildasm.exe (again, see Chapter 1).
    Figure 3-12 shows what you would find if you were to generate CIL code for the StringsAreImmutable()
    method.</p>
    <img src="../Images/Figure03_12.png" alt="Figure 3-12" />
    <p><b>Figure 3-12</b> Assigning a value to a string object results in a new string object</p>
    <p>Although we have yet to examine the low-level details of the CIL, note the numerous calls to the
    ldstr (load string) opcode. Simply put, the ldstr opcode of the CIL loads a new string object on the
    managed heap. The previous string object that contained the value "My other string." will eventually
    be garbage collected.</p>
    <p>So, what exactly are we to gather from this insight? In a nutshell, the string class can be inefficient
    and result in bloated code if misused, especially when performing string concatenation. If you need to
    represent basic character data such as a U.S. Social Security number, first or last names, or simple bits of
    text used within your application, the string class is the perfect choice.</p>
    <p>However, if you are building an application that makes heavy use of textual data (such as a word
    processing program), it would be a very bad idea to represent the word processing data using string
    objects, as you will most certainly (and often indirectly) end up making unnecessary copies of string
    data. So what is a programmer to do? Glad you asked.</p>
    <h2>The System.Text.StringBuilder Type</h2>
    <p>Given that the string type can be inefficient when used with reckless abandon, the .NET base class
    libraries provide the System.Text namespace. Within this (relatively small) namespace lives a class
    named StringBuilder. Like the System.String class, the StringBuilder defines methods that allow you
    to replace or format segments, for example. When you wish to use this type in your C# code files, your
    first step is to make sure the following namespace is imported into your code file: </p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// StringBuilder lives here!</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Text;</pre>
    <p>What is unique about the StringBuilder is that when you call members of this type, you are directly
    modifying the object's internal character data (making it more efficient), not obtaining a copy of the data
    in a modified format. When you create an instance of the StringBuilder, you can supply the object's
    initial startup values via one of many constructors. If you are new to the topic of constructors, simply
    understand that constructors allow you to create an object with an initial state when you apply the new
    keyword. Consider the following usage of StringBuilder:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> FunWithStringBuilder()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"=&gt; Using the StringBuilder:"</span>);
    StringBuilder sb = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringBuilder(<span class="str">"**** Fantastic Games ****"</span>);
    sb.Append(<span class="str">"\n"</span>);
    sb.AppendLine(<span class="str">"Half Life"</span>);
    sb.AppendLine(<span class="str">"Beyond Good and Evil"</span>);
    sb.AppendLine(<span class="str">"Deus Ex 2"</span>);
    sb.AppendLine(<span class="str">"System Shock"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());

    sb.Replace(<span class="str">"2"</span>, <span class="str">"Invisible War"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"sb has {0} chars."</span>, sb.Length);
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Here we have constructed a StringBuilder set to the initial value "**** Fantastic Games ****". As
    you can see, we are appending to the internal buffer and are able to replace or remove characters at will.
    By default, a StringBuilder is only able to initially hold a string of 16 characters or fewer (but will expand
    automatically if necessary); however, this default starting value can be changed via an additional
    constructor argument.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Make a StringBuilder with an initial size of 256.</span>
StringBuilder sb = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringBuilder(<span class="str">"**** Fantastic Games ****"</span>, 256);</pre>
    <p>If you append more characters than the specified limit, the StringBuilder object will copy its data
