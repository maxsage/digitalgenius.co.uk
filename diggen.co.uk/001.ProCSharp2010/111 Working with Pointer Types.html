<h1>Working with Pointer Types</h1>
 <p>And now, the final topic of the chapter, which most likely will be the least-used of all C# features for the
vast majority of your .NET projects. In Chapter 4, you learned that the .NET platform defines two major
categories of data: value types and reference types. Truth be told, however, there is a third category:
pointer types. To work with pointer types, we get specific operators and keywords that allow us to bypass
the CLR’s memory-management scheme and take matters into our own hands (see Table 12-3).</p>
<p><b>Table 12-3. </b>Pointer-Centric C# Operators and Keywords</p>

</table>
<p>Now, before we dig into the details, let me again point out that you will seldom if ever need to make
use of pointer types. Although C# does allow you to drop down to the level of pointer manipulations,
understand that the .NET runtime has absolutely no clue of your intentions. Thus, if you mismanage a
pointer, you are the one in charge of dealing with the consequences. Given these warnings, when exactly
would you need to work with pointer types? There are two common situations:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You are looking to optimize select parts of your application by directly
manipulating memory outside the management of the CLR.</li>
 <li>You are calling methods of a C-based .dll or COM server that demand pointer
types as parameters. Even in this case, you can often bypass pointer types in favor
of the System.IntPtr type and members of the System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal type.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that you do decide to make use of this C# language feature, you are required to inform
the C# compiler (csc.exe) of your intentions by enabling your project to support “unsafe code.” To do so
at the command line, simply supply the /unsafe flag as an argument:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
csc /<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> *.cs</pre>
<p>From Visual Studio 2010, you will need to access your project’s Properties page and check the Allow
Unsafe Code box from the Build tab (see Figure 12-7). To experiment with pointer types, create a new
Console Application project named UnsafeCode and enable unsafe code.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure12_07.png" alt="Figure 12-7" />
<p><b>Figure 12-7. </b>Enabling unsafe code using Visual Studio 2010</p>
<p><b>Note </b>In the examples that follow, I’m assuming you have some background in C(++) pointer manipulation. If
this is not true, feel free to skip this topic entirely. Again, writing unsafe code will not be a common task for the
vast majority of C# applications.</p>
<h2>The unsafe Keyword</h2>
  <p>When you wish to work with pointers in C#, you must specifically declare a block of “unsafe code” using
the unsafe keyword (any code that is not marked with the unsafe keyword is considered “safe”
automatically). For example, the following Program class declares a scope of unsafe code within the safe
Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">unsafe</span>
        {
            <span class="rem">// Work with pointer types here!</span>
        }
        <span class="rem">// Can't work with pointers here!</span>
    }
}</pre>
<p>In addition to declaring a scope of unsafe code within a method, you can build structures, classes,
type members, and parameters that are “unsafe.” Here are a few examples to gnaw on (no need to define
these types in your current project):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This entire structure is "unsafe" and can</span>
<span class="rem">// be used only in an unsafe context.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">struct</span> Node
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Value;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Node* Left;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Node* Right;
}

<span class="rem">// This struct is safe, but the Node2* members</span>
<span class="rem">// are not. Technically, you may access "Value" from</span>
<span class="rem">// outside an unsafe context, but not "Left" and "Right".</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">struct</span> Node2
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Value;

    <span class="rem">// These can be accessed only in an unsafe context!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> Node2* Left;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> Node2* Right;
}</pre>
<p>Methods (static or instance level) may be marked as unsafe as well. For example, assume that you
know a particular static method will make use of pointer logic. To ensure that this method can be called
only from an unsafe context, you could define the method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SquareIntPointer(<span class="kwrd">int</span>* myIntPointer)
{
    <span class="rem">// Square the value just for a test.</span>
    *myIntPointer *= *myIntPointer;
}</pre>
<p>The configuration of our method demands that the caller invoke SquareIntPointer() as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="kwrd">unsafe</span>
    {
        <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 10;

        <span class="rem">// OK, because we are in an unsafe context.</span>
        SquareIntPointer(&amp;myInt);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myInt: {0}"</span>, myInt);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt2 = 5;
    
    <span class="rem">// Compiler error! Must be in unsafe context!</span>
    SquareIntPointer(&amp;myInt2);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myInt: {0}"</span>, myInt2);
}</pre>
<p>If you would rather not force the caller to wrap the invocation within an unsafe context, you could
update Main() with the unsafe keyword. In this case, the following code would compile:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt2 = 5;
    SquareIntPointer(&amp;myInt2);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myInt: {0}"</span>, myInt2);
}</pre>
<h2>Working with the * and &amp; Operators</h2>
  <p>Once you have established an unsafe context, you are then free to build pointers to data types using the
* operator and obtain the address of said pointer using the &amp; operator. Unlike in C or C++, in C# the *
operator is applied to the underlying type only, not as a prefix to each pointer variable name. For
example, consider the following code, which illustrates both the correct and incorrect ways to declare
pointers to integer variables:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// No! This is incorrect under C#!</span>
<span class="kwrd">int</span> *pi, *pj;

<span class="rem">// Yes! This is the way of C#.</span>
<span class="kwrd">int</span>* pi, pj;</pre>
<p>Consider the following unsafe method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintValueAndAddress()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt;

    <span class="rem">// Define an int pointer, and</span>
    <span class="rem">// assign it the address of myInt.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>* ptrToMyInt = &amp;myInt;
    
    <span class="rem">// Assign value of myInt using pointer indirection.</span>
    *ptrToMyInt = 123;

    <span class="rem">// Print some stats.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Value of myInt {0}"</span>, myInt);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Address of myInt {0:X}"</span>, (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)&amp;ptrToMyInt);
}</pre>
<h2>An Unsafe (and Safe) Swap Function</h2>
  <p>Of course, declaring pointers to local variables simply to assign their value (as in the previous example)
is never required and not altogether useful. To illustrate a more practical example of unsafe code,
assume you wish to build a swap function using pointer arithmetic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UnsafeSwap(<span class="kwrd">int</span>* i, <span class="kwrd">int</span>* j)
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> temp = *i;
    *i = *j;
    *j = temp;
}</pre>
<p>Very C-like, don’t you think? However, given your work in Chapter, you should be aware that you
could write the following safe version of your swap algorithm using the C# ref keyword:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SafeSwap(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> i, <span class="kwrd">ref</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> j)
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> temp = i;
    i = j;
    j = temp;
}</pre>
<p>The functionality of each method is identical, thus reinforcing the point that direct pointer
manipulation is not a mandatory task under C#. Here is the calling logic using a safe Main(), with an
unsafe context:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Calling method with unsafe code *****"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Values for swap.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 10, j = 20;

    <span class="rem">// Swap values "safely."</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\n***** Safe swap *****"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Values before safe swap: i = {0}, j = {1}"</span>, i, j);
    SafeSwap(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> i, <span class="kwrd">ref</span> j);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Values after safe swap: i = {0}, j = {1}"</span>, i, j);

    <span class="rem">// Swap values "unsafely."</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\n***** Unsafe swap *****"</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Values before unsafe swap: i = {0}, j = {1}"</span>, i, j);
    
    <span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> { UnsafeSwap(&amp;i, &amp;j); }
    
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Values after unsafe swap: i = {0}, j = {1}"</span>, i, j);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Field Access via Pointers (the -> Operator)</h2>
  <p>Now assume you have defined a simple, safe Point structure as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">struct</span> Point
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> x;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> y;
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"({0}, {1})"</span>, x, y);
    }
}</pre>
 <p>If you declare a pointer to a Point type, you will need to make use of the pointer field-access
operator (represented by -&gt;) to access its public members. As shown in Table 12-3, this is the unsafe
version of the standard (safe) dot operator (.). In fact, using the pointer indirection operator (*), it is
possible to dereference a pointer to (once again) apply the dot operator notation. Check out the unsafe
method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UsePointerToPoint()
{
    <span class="rem">// Access members via pointer.</span>
    Point point;
    Point* p = &amp;point;
    p-&gt;x = 100;
    p-&gt;y = 200;
    Console.WriteLine(p-&gt;ToString());
    
    <span class="rem">// Access members via pointer indirection.</span>
    Point point2;
    Point* p2 = &amp;point2;
    (*p2).x = 100;
    (*p2).y = 200;
    Console.WriteLine((*p2).ToString());
}</pre>
<h2>The stackalloc Keyword</h2>
  <p>In an unsafe context, you may need to declare a local variable that allocates memory directly from the
call stack (and is therefore not subject to .NET garbage collection). To do so, C# provides the stackalloc
keyword, which is the C# equivalent to the _alloca function of the C runtime library. Here is a simple
example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UnsafeStackAlloc()
{
    <span class="kwrd">char</span>* p = <span class="kwrd">stackalloc</span> <span class="kwrd">char</span>[256];
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> k = 0; k &lt; 256; k++)
        p[k] = (<span class="kwrd">char</span>)k;
}</pre>
<h2>Pinning a Type via the fixed Keyword</h2>
  <p>As you saw in the previous example, allocating a chunk of memory within an unsafe context may be
facilitated via the stackalloc keyword. By the very nature of this operation, the allocated memory is
cleaned up as soon as the allocating method has returned (as the memory is acquired from the stack).
However, assume a more complex example. During our examination of the -&gt; operator, you created a
value type named Point. Like all value types, the allocated memory is popped off the stack once the
executing scope has terminated. For the sake of argument, assume Point was instead defined as a
reference type:</p>  
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> PointRef <span class="rem">// &lt;= Renamed and retyped.</span>
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> x;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> y;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"({0}, {1})"</span>, x, y);
    }
}</pre>
<p>As you are aware, if the caller declares a variable of type Point, the memory is allocated on the
garbage-collected heap. The burning question then becomes, “What if an unsafe context wishes to
interact with this object (or any object on the heap)?” Given that garbage collection can occur at any
moment, imagine the problems encountered when accessing the members of Point at the very point in
time such a sweep of the heap is under way. Theoretically, it is possible that the unsafe context is
attempting to interact with a member that is no longer accessible or has been repositioned on the heap
after surviving a generational sweep (which is an obvious problem).</p>
<p>To lock a reference type variable in memory from an unsafe context, C# provides the fixed keyword.
The fixed statement sets a pointer to a managed type and “pins” that variable during the execution of
the code. Without fixed, pointers to managed variables would be of little use, since garbage collection
could relocate the variables unpredictably. (In fact, the C# compiler will not allow you to set a pointer to
a managed variable except in a fixed statement.)</p>
<p>Thus, if you create a PointRef type and want to interact with its members, you must write the
following code (or receive a compiler error):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UseAndPinPoint()
{
    PointRef pt = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PointRef ();
    pt.x = 5;
    pt.y = 6;

    <span class="rem">// pin pt in place so it will not</span>
    <span class="rem">// be moved or GC-ed.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">fixed</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span>* p = &amp;pt.x)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Use int* variable here!</span>
    }

    <span class="rem">// pt is now unpinned, and ready to be GC-ed once</span>
    <span class="rem">// the method completes.</span>
    Console.WriteLine (<span class="str">"Point is: {0}"</span>, pt);
}</pre>
<p>In a nutshell, the fixed keyword allows you to build a statement that locks a reference variable in
memory, such that its address remains constant for the duration of the statement (or scope block). Any
time you interact with a reference type from within the context of unsafe code, pinning the reference is a
must.</p>
<h2>The sizeof Keyword</h2>
  <p>The final unsafe-centric C# keyword to consider is sizeof. As in C(++), the C# sizeof keyword is used to
obtain the size in bytes of a value type (never a reference type), and it may only be used within an unsafe
context. As you may imagine, this ability can prove helpful when you’re interacting with unmanaged Cbased
APIs. Its usage is straightforward:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UseSizeOfOperator()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The size of short is {0}."</span>, <span class="kwrd">sizeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">short</span>));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The size of int is {0}."</span>, <span class="kwrd">sizeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span>));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The size of long is {0}."</span>, <span class="kwrd">sizeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">long</span>));
}</pre>
<p>As sizeof will evaluate the number of bytes for any System.ValueType-derived entity, you can obtain
the size of custom structures as well. For example, we could pass the Point structure into sizeof as
follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">unsafe</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UseSizeOfOperator()
{
...
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The size of Point is {0}."</span>, <span class="kwrd">sizeof</span>(Point));
}</pre>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The UnsafeCode project can be found under the Chapter 12 subdirectory.</p>
<p>That wraps up our look at some of the more powerful features of the C# programming language. In
the next chapter, you will see some of these concepts (specifically extension methods and anonymous
types) doing very useful things in the context of LINQ to Objects.</p>
