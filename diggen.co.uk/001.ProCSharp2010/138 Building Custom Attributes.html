<h1>Building Custom Attributes</h1>
<p>The first step in building a custom attribute is to create a new class deriving from System.Attribute.
Keeping in step with the automobile theme used throughout this book, assume you have created a brand
new C# Class Library project named AttributedCarLibrary. This assembly will define a handful of
vehicles, each of which is described using a custom attribute named VehicleDescriptionAttribute:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A custom attribute.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> VehicleDescriptionAttribute : System.Attribute
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Description { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> VehicleDescriptionAttribute(<span class="kwrd">string</span> vehicalDescription)
    {
        Description = vehicalDescription;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> VehicleDescriptionAttribute(){ }
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, VehicleDescriptionAttribute maintains a piece of string data manipulated using an
automatic property (Description). Beyond the fact that this class derived from System.Attribute, there
is nothing unique to this class definition.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> For security reasons, it is considered a .NET best practice to design all custom attributes as sealed. In
fact, Visual Studio 2010 provides a code snippet named Attribute that will dump out a new
System.Attribute-derived class into your code window. See Chapter 2 for an explication of using code
snippets.</p>
<h2>Applying Custom Attributes</h2>
<p>Given that VehicleDescriptionAttribute is derived from System.Attribute, you are now able to
annotate your vehicles as you see fit. For testing purposes, add the following class definitions to your
new class library:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Assign description using a "named property."</span>
[Serializable]
[VehicleDescription(Description = <span class="str">"My rocking Harley"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
}

[SerializableAttribute]
[ObsoleteAttribute(<span class="str">"Use another vehicle!"</span>)]
[VehicleDescription(<span class="str">"The old gray mare, she ain't what she used to be..."</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> HorseAndBuggy
{
}

[VehicleDescription(<span class="str">"A very long, slow, but feature-rich auto"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Winnebago
{
}</pre>
<h2>Named Property Syntax</h2>
<p>Notice that the description of the Motorcycle is assigned a description using a new bit of attributecentric
syntax termed a named property. In the constructor of the first [VehicleDescription] attribute,
you set the underlying string data by using the Description property. If this attribute is reflected upon
by an external agent, the value is fed into the Description property (named property syntax is legal only
if the attribute supplies a writable .NET property).</p>
<p>In contrast, the HorseAndBuggy and Winnebago types are not making use of named property syntax
and are simply passing the string data via the custom constructor. In any case, once you compile the
AttributedCarLibrary assembly, you can make use of ildasm.exe to view the injected metadata
descriptions for your type. For example, Figure 15-5 shows an embedded description of the Winnebago
class, specifically the data within the beforefieldinit item in ildasm.exe.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure15_05.png" alt="Figure 15-5" />
<p><b>Figure 15-5</b> Embedded vehicle description data</p>
<h2>Restricting Attribute Usage</h2>
<p>By default, custom attributes can be applied to just about any aspect of your code (methods, classes,
properties, and so on). Thus, if it made sense to do so, you could use VehicleDescription to qualify
methods, properties, or fields (among other things):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[VehicleDescription(<span class="str">"A very long, slow, but feature-rich auto"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Winnebago
{
    [VehicleDescription(<span class="str">"My rocking CD player"</span>)]
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PlayMusic(<span class="kwrd">bool</span> On)
    {
        ...
    }
}</pre>
<p>In some cases, this is exactly the behavior you require. Other times, however, you may want to build
a custom attribute that can be applied only to select code elements. If you wish to constrain the scope of
a custom attribute, you will need to apply the [AttributeUsage] attribute on the definition of your
custom attribute. The [AttributeUsage] attribute allows you to supply any -combination of values (via
an OR operation) from the AttributeTargets enumeration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This enumeration defines the possible targets of an attribute.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> AttributeTargets
{
    All, Assembly, Class, Constructor,
    Delegate, Enum, Event, Field, GenericParameter,
    Interface, Method, Module, Parameter,
    Property, ReturnValue, Struct
}</pre>
<p>Furthermore, [AttributeUsage] also allows you to optionally set a named property (AllowMultiple)
that specifies whether the attribute can be applied more than once on the same item (the default is
false). As well, [AttributeUsage] allows you to establish whether the attribute should be inherited by
derived classes using the Inherited named property (the default is true).</p>
<p>To establish that the [VehicleDescription] attribute can be applied only once on a class or
structure, you can update the VehicleDescriptionAttribute definition as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This time, we are using the AttributeUsage attribute</span>
<span class="rem">// to annotate our custom attribute.</span>
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Struct,
    Inherited = <span class="kwrd">false</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> VehicleDescriptionAttribute : System.Attribute
{
...
}</pre>
<p>With this, if a developer attempted to apply the [VehicleDescription] attribute on anything other
than a class or structure, he or she is issued a compile-time error.</p>
