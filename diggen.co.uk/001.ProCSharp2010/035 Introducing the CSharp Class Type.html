    <h1>Introducing the C# Class Type</h1>
   <p>As far as the .NET platform is concerned, the most fundamental programming construct is the class type. Formally, 
   a class is a user-defined type that is composed of field data (often called member variables) and members that
   operate on this data (such as constructors, properties, methods, events, and so forth). Collectively, the set of 
   field data represents the "state" of a class instance (otherwise known as an object). The power of object-based 
   languages such as C# is that by grouping data and related functionality in a unified class definition, you are 
   able to model your software after entities in the real world.</p>
   <p>To get the ball rolling, create a new C# Console Application named SimpleClassExample. Next, insert a new 
   class file (named Car.cs) into your project using the Project ? Add Class... menu selection, choose the Class
    icon from the resulting dialog box as shown in Figure 5-1, and click the Add button.</p>
   <p>A class is defined in C# using the class keyword. Here is the simplest possible declaration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
}</pre>
	<p>Once you have defined a class type, you will need to consider the set of member variables that will
	be used to represent its state. For example, you may decide that cars maintain an int data type to
	represent the current speed and a string data type to represent the car�s friendly pet name. Given these
	initial design notes, update your Car class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="rem">// The 'state' of the Car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> petName;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> currSpeed;
}</pre>
   <img src="../Images/Figure05_01.png" alt="Figure 5-1" />
   <p><b>Figure 5-1.</b> Inserting a new C# class type</p>
   <p>Notice that these member variables are declared using the public access modifier. Public members of a
    class are directly accessible once an object of this type has been created. Recall the term "object" is used 
    to represent an instance of a given class type created using the new keyword.</p>
   <p><b>Note</b> Field data of a class should seldom (if ever) be defined as public. To preserve the integrity 
   of your state data, it is a far better design to define data as private (or possibly protected) and allow 
   controlled access to the data via type properties (as shown later in this chapter). However, to keep this
    first example as simple as possible, public data fits the bill.</p>
   <p>After you have defined the set of member variables that represent the state of the class, the next 
   design step is to establish the members that model its behavior. For this example, the Car class will 
   define one method named SpeedUp() and another named PrintState(). Update your class as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="rem">// The 'state' of the Car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> petName;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> currSpeed;

    <span class="rem">// The functionality of the Car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintState()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} is going {1} MPH."</span>, petName, currSpeed);
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SpeedUp(<span class="kwrd">int</span> delta)
    {
        currSpeed += delta;
    }
}</pre>
   <p>PrintState() is more or less a diagnostic function that will simply dump the current state of a given 
   Car object to the command window. SpeedUp() will increase the speed of the Car by the amount specified 
   by the incoming int parameter. Now, update your Main() method in the Program class with the following 
   code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Allocate and configure a Car object.</span>
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    myCar.petName = <span class="str">"Henry"</span>;
    myCar.currSpeed = 10;

    <span class="rem">// Speed up the car a few times and print out the</span>
    <span class="rem">// new state.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt;= 10; i++)
    {
        myCar.SpeedUp(5);
        myCar.PrintState();
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
   <p>Once you run your program, you will see that the Car variable (myCar) maintains its current
   state throughout the life of the application, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Class Types *****

Henry is going 15 MPH.
Henry is going 20 MPH.
Henry is going 25 MPH.
Henry is going 30 MPH.
Henry is going 35 MPH.
Henry is going 40 MPH.
Henry is going 45 MPH.
Henry is going 50 MPH.
Henry is going 55 MPH.
Henry is going 60 MPH.
Henry is going 65 MPH.
</pre>
   <h2>Allocating Objects with the new Keyword</h2>
   <p>As shown in the previous code example, objects must be allocated into memory using the new 
   keyword. If you do not make use of the new keyword and attempt to make use of your class variable
   in a subsequent code statement, you will receive a compiler error. For example, the following 
   Main() method will not compile:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Error! Forgot to use 'new' to create object!</span>
    Car myCar;
    myCar.petName = <span class="str">"Fred"</span>;
}</pre>
   <p>To correctly create an object using the new keyword, you may define and allocate a Car object 
   on a single line of code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    myCar.petName = <span class="str">"Fred"</span>;
}</pre>
   <p>As an alternative, if you wish to define and allocate a class instance on separate lines of code, 
   you may do so as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Class Types *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar;
    myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    myCar.petName = <span class="str">"Fred"</span>;
}</pre>
   <p>Here, the first code statement simply declares a reference to a yet-to-be-determined Car object. 
   It is not until you assign a reference to an object that this reference points to a valid object 
   in memory.</p>
   <p>In any case, at this point we have a trivial class that defines a few points of data and some 
   basic methods. To enhance the functionality of the current Car class, we need to understand the 
   role of constructors.</p>
