<h1>The Role of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR)</h1>
<p>Now that you better understand what “dynamic data” is all about, let’s learn how it is processed. With
the release of .NET 4.0, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) has a complementary runtime
environment named the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR). The concept of a ‘dynamic runtime’ is
certainly not new. In fact, many programming languages such as Smalltalk, LISP, Ruby and Python have
used them for years. In a nutshell, a dynamic runtime allows a dynamic language the ability to discover
types completely at runtime with no compile time checks.</p>    
<p>If you have a background in strongly typed languages (including C#, without dynamic types) the
very notion of such a runtime may seem undesirable. After all, you typically want to receive compile
time errors, not runtime errors, wherever possible. Nevertheless, dynamic languages/runtimes do
provide some interesting features including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>An extremely flexible code base. You can refactor code without making numerous
changes to data types.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>A very simple way to interoperate with diverse object types built in different
platforms and programming languages.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>A way to add or remove members to a type, in memory, at runtime.</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The role of the DLR is to enable various dynamic languages to run with the .NET runtime and give
them a way to interoperate with other .NET code. Two popular dynamic languages which make use of
the DLR are IronPython and IronRuby. These languages live in a dynamic universe, where type is
discovered solely at runtime. And yet, these languages have access to the richness of the .NET base class
libraries. Even better, their codebases can interoperate with C# (or vice versa), thanks to the inclusion of
the dynamic keyword.</p>
<h2>The Role of Expression Trees</h2>
<p>The DLR makes use of expression trees to capture the meaning of a dynamic call in neutral terms. For
example, when the DLR encounters some C# code such as the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
dynamic d = GetSomeData();
d.SuperMethod(12);</pre>
<p>It will automatically build an expression tree which says in effect “Call the method named
SuperMethod on object d, passing in the number 12 as an argument”. This information (formally termed
the payload) is then passed to the correct runtime binder, which again could be the C# dynamic binder,
the IronPython dynamic binder, or even (as explained shortly) legacy COM objects.</p>
<p>From here, the request is mapped into the required call structure for the target object. The nice
thing about these expression trees (beyond the fact that you don’t need to manually create them) is that
this allows us to write a fixed C# code statement, and not worry about what the underlying target
actually is (COM object, IronPython, or IronRuby codebase, etc). Figure 18-3 illustrates the concept of
expression trees from a high level.</p>

<h2>The Role of the System.Dynamic Namespace</h2>
<p>With the release of .NET 4.0, Microsoft introduced the System.Dynamic namespace within the
System.Core.dll assembly. Truth be told, the chances that you will need to ever directly use the types
within this namespace are slim to none. However, if you were a language vendor, who wanted to enable
their dynamic languages to interact with the DLR, you could make use of System.Dynamic namespace to
build a custom runtime binder.</p>
<p>Again, you won’t need to directly dig into the types of System.Dynamic in this book, however feel free
to check it out using the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation if you are interested. For practical
purposes, simply know that this namespace provides the necessary infrastructure to make a dynamic
language “.NET aware”.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Runtime Lookup of Expression Trees</h2>
<p>As explained, the DLR will pass the expression trees to a target object, however this dispatching will be
influenced by a few factors. If the dynamic data type is pointing in memory to a COM object, the
expression tree is sent to a low-level COM interface named IDispatch. As you may know, this interface
was COM’s way of incorporating its own set of dynamic services. COM objects, however, can be used in
a .NET application without the use of the DLR or C# dynamic keyword. Doing so however (as you will see)
tends to result in much more complex C# coding.</p>
<p>If the dynamic data is not pointing to a COM object, the expression tree may be passed to an object
implementing the IDynamicObject interface. This interface is used behind the scenes to allow a language
such as IronRuby to take a DLR expression tree and map it to Ruby-specifics.</p>
<p>Finally, if the dynamic data is pointing to an object which is not a COM object and does not
implement IDynamicObject, the object is a normal, everyday .NET object. In this case, the expression tree
is dispatched to the C# runtime binder for processing. The process of mapping the expression tree to
.NET specifics involves reflection services.</p>
<p>Once the expression tree has been processed by a given binder, the dynamic data will be resolved to
the real in-memory data type, after which the correct method is called with any necessary parameters.
Now, let’s see a few practical uses of the DLR, beginning with the simplification of late bound .NET calls.</p>
