    <h1>Methods and Parameter Modifiers</h1>
    <p>To begin this chapter, let's examine the details of defining methods. Just like the Main() method (see
    Chapter 3), your custom methods may or may not take parameters and may or may not return values to
    the caller. As you will see over the next several chapters, methods can be implemented within the scope
    of classes or structures (as well as prototyped within interface types) and may be decorated with various
    keywords (e.g., internal, virtual, public, new) to qualify their behavior. At this point in the text, each of
    our methods has followed this basic format:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Recall that static methods can be called directly</span>
<span class="rem">// without creating a class instance.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="rem">// static returnType MethodName(params) {...}</span>
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y){ <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y; }
}</pre>
    <p>While the definition of a method in C# is quite straightforward, there are a handful of keywords that
    you can use to control how arguments are passed to the method in question. These are listed in Table 4-1.</p>
    <table class="gridtable">
        <tr>
            <th>
                Parameter Modifier
            </th>
            <th>
                Meaning in Life
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                (None)
            </td>
            <td>
                If a parameter is not marked with a parameter modifier, it is assumed to be passed
                by value, meaning the called method receives a copy of the original data.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                out
            </td>
            <td>
                Output parameters must be assigned by the method being called, and therefore are
                passed by reference. If the called method fails to assign output parameters, you
                are issued a compiler error.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                ref
            </td>
            <td>
                The value is initially assigned by the caller and may be optionally reassigned by
                the called method (as the data is also passed by reference). No compiler error is
                generated if the called method fails to assign a ref parameter.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                params
            </td>
            <td>
                This parameter modifier allows you to send in a variable number of arguments as
                a single logical parameter. A method can have only a single params modifier, and
                it must be the final parameter of the method. In reality, you may not need to use
                the params modifier all too often, however be aware that numerous methods within
                the base class libraries do make use of this C# language feature.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>To illustrate the use of these keywords, create a new Console Application project named
    FunWithMethods. Now, let's walk through the role of each keyword.</p>
    <h2>The Default Parameter-Passing Behavior</h2>
    <p>The default manner in which a parameter is sent into a function is by value. Simply put, if you do not
    mark an argument with a parameter modifier, a copy of the data is passed into the function. As
    explained at the end of this chapter, exactly what is copied will depend on whether the parameter is a
    value type or a reference type. For the time being, assume the following method within the Program class
    that operates on two numerical data types passed by value:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Arguments are passed by value by default.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> ans = x + y;

    <span class="rem">// Caller will not see these changes</span>
    <span class="rem">// as you are modifying a copy of the</span>
    <span class="rem">// original data.</span>
    x = 10000;
    y = 88888;
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> ans;
}</pre>    
    <p>Numerical data falls under the category of value types. Therefore, if you change the values of the
    parameters within the scope of the member, the caller is blissfully unaware, given that you are changing
    the values on a copy of the caller's original data:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Pass two variables in by value.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> x = 9, y = 10;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Before call: X: {0}, Y: {1}"</span>, x, y);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Answer is: {0}"</span>, Add(x, y));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After call: X: {0}, Y: {1}"</span>, x, y);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>As you would hope, the values of x and y remain identical before and after the call to Add(), as
    shown in the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Methods *****
Before call: X: 9, Y: 10
Answer <span class="kwrd">is</span>: 19
After call: X: 9, Y: 10
</pre>
    <h2>The out Modifier</h2>
     <p>Next, you have the use of output parameters. Methods that have been defined to take output parameters
    (via the out keyword) are under obligation to assign them to an appropriate value before exiting the
    method scope (if you fail to do so, you will receive compiler errors).</p>
     <p>To illustrate, here is an alternative version of the Add() method that returns the sum of two integers
    using the C# out modifier (note the physical return value of this method is now void):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Output parameters must be assigned by the called method.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y, <span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> ans)
{
    ans = x + y;
}</pre>
    <p>Calling a method with output parameters also requires the use of the out modifier. However, the
    local variables which are passed as output variables are not required to be assigned before passing them
    in as output arguments (if you do so, the original value is lost after the call). The reason the compiler
    allows you to send in seemingly unassigned data is due to the fact that the method being called must
    make an assignment. The following code is an example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****"</span>);
...
    <span class="rem">// No need to assign initial value to local variables</span>
    <span class="rem">// used as output parameters, provided the first time</span>
    <span class="rem">// you use them is as output arguments.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> ans;
    Add(90, 90, <span class="kwrd">out</span> ans);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"90 + 90 = {0}"</span>, ans);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>The previous example is intended to be illustrative in nature; you really have no reason to return the
    value of your summation using an output parameter. However, the C# out modifier does serve a very
    useful purpose: it allows the caller to obtain multiple return values from a single method invocation.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Returning multiple output parameters.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> FillTheseValues(<span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> a, <span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> b, <span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> c)
{
    a = 9;
    b = <span class="str">"Enjoy your string."</span>;
    c = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
}</pre>
    <p>The caller would be able to invoke the FillTheseValues() method. Do notice that you must use the
    out modifier when you invoke the method, as well as when you implement the method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****"</span>);
...
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> i; <span class="kwrd">string</span> str; <span class="kwrd">bool</span> b;
    FillTheseValues(<span class="kwrd">out</span> i, <span class="kwrd">out</span> str, <span class="kwrd">out</span> b);
 
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Int is: {0}"</span>, i);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"String is: {0}"</span>, str);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Boolean is: {0}"</span>, b);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Finally, always remember that a method that defines output parameters must assign the parameter
    to a valid value before exiting the method scope. Therefore, the following code will result in a compiler
    error, as the output parameter has not been assigned within the method scope:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ThisWontCompile(<span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> a)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error! Forgot to assign output arg!"</span>);
}</pre>
    <h2>The ref Modifier</h2>
    <p>Now consider the use of the C# ref parameter modifier. Reference parameters are necessary when you
    wish to allow a method to operate on (and usually change the values of) various data points declared in
    the caller's scope (such as a sorting or swapping routine). Note the distinction between output and
    reference parameters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Output parameters do not need to be initialized before they passed to the method.
        The reason for this? The method must assign output parameters before exiting.</li>
        <li>Reference parameters must be initialized before they are passed to the method.
        The reason for this is that you are passing a reference to an existing variable. If you
        don't assign it to an initial value, that would be the equivalent of operating on an
        unassigned local variable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's check out the use of the ref keyword by way of a method that swaps two string variables:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Reference parameters.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SwapStrings(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> s1, <span class="kwrd">ref</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> s2)
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> tempStr = s1;
    s1 = s2;
    s2 = tempStr;
}</pre>
    <p>This method can be called as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****"</span>);
...
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s1 = <span class="str">"Flip"</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> s2 = <span class="str">"Flop"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Before: {0}, {1} "</span>, s1, s2);
    SwapStrings(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> s1, <span class="kwrd">ref</span> s2);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"After: {0}, {1} "</span>, s1, s2);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Here, the caller has assigned an initial value to local string data (s1 and s2). Once the call to
    SwapStrings() returns, s1 now contains the value "Flop", while s2 reports the value "Flip":</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
Before: Flip, Flop
After: Flop, Flip</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> The C# ref keyword will be revisited later in this chapter in the section "Understanding Value Types and
    Reference Types." As you will see, the behavior of this keyword changes just a bit depending on whether the
    argument is a value type (structure) or reference type (class).</p>
    <h2>The params Modifier</h2>
    <p>C# supports the use of parameter arrays using the params keyword. To understand this language feature
    you must (as the name implies) understand how to manipulate C# arrays. If this is not the case, you may
    wish to return to this section once you read the section "Array Manipulation in C#" found a bit later in
    this chapter.</p>
    <p>The params keyword allows you to pass into a method a variable number of identically typed parameters as a single logical parameter. As well, 
    arguments marked with the params keyword can be processed if the caller sends in a strongly typed array or 
    a comma-delimited list of items. Yes, this can be confusing! To clear things up, assume you wish to 
    create a function that allows the caller to pass in any number of arguments and return the calculated average.</p>
    <p>If you were to prototype this method to take an array of doubles, this would force the caller to first
    define the array, then fill the array, and finally pass it into the method. However, if you define
    CalculateAverage() to take a params of double data types, the caller can simply pass a comma-delimited
    list of doubles. The .NET runtime will automatically package the set of doubles into an array of type
    double behind the scenes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Return average of "some number" of doubles.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> CalculateAverage(<span class="kwrd">params</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span>[] values)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"You sent me {0} doubles."</span>, values.Length);

    <span class="kwrd">double</span> sum = 0;
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(values.Length == 0)
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> sum;
    
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; values.Length; i++)
        sum += values[i];
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> (sum / values.Length);
}</pre>
    <p>This method has been defined to take a parameter array of doubles. What this method is in fact
    saying is, "Send me any number of doubles (including zero) and I'll compute the average." Given this,
    you can call CalculateAverage() in any of the following ways:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****"</span>);
...
    <span class="rem">// Pass in a comma-delimited list of doubles...</span>
    <span class="kwrd">double</span> average;
    average = CalculateAverage(4.0, 3.2, 5.7, 64.22, 87.2);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Average of data is: {0}"</span>, average);

    <span class="rem">// ...or pass an array of doubles.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">double</span>[] data = { 4.0, 3.2, 5.7 };
    average = CalculateAverage(data);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Average of data is: {0}"</span>, average);

    <span class="rem">// Average of 0 is 0!</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Average of data is: {0}"</span>, CalculateAverage());
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>If you did not make use of the params modifier in the definition of CalculateAverage(), the first
    invocation of this method would result in a compiler error, as the compiler would be looking for a
    version of CalculateAverage() which took five double arguments.</p>
    <p><b>Note </b>To avoid any ambiguity, C# demands a method only support single params argument, which must be the
    final argument in the parameter list.</p>
    <p>As you might guess, this technique is nothing more than a convenience for the caller, given that the
    array is created by the CLR as necessary. By the time the array is within the scope of the method being
    called, you are able to treat it as a full-blown .NET array that contains all the functionality of the
    System.Array base class library type. Consider the following output:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
You sent me 5 doubles.
Average of data <span class="kwrd">is</span>: 32.864
You sent me 3 doubles.
Average of data <span class="kwrd">is</span>: 4.3
You sent me 0 doubles.
Average of data <span class="kwrd">is</span>: 0</pre>
    <h2>Defining Optional Parameters</h2>
    <p>With the release of .NET 4.0, C# programmers are now able to create methods which can take optional
    arguments. This technique allows the caller to invoke a single method while omitting arguments deemed
    unnecessary, provided the caller is happy with the specified defaults.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> As you will see in Chapter 18, a key motivation for adding optional arguments to C# is to simplify
    interacting with COM objects. Several Microsoft object models (e.g., Microsoft Office) expose their functionality via
    COM objects, many of which were written long ago to make use of optional parameters.</p>
    <p>To illustrate working with optional arguments, assume you have a method named EnterLogData(),
    which defines a single optional parameter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> EnterLogData(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message, <span class="kwrd">string</span> owner = <span class="str">"Programmer"</span>)
{
    Console.Beep();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error: {0}"</span>, message);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Owner of Error: {0}"</span>, owner);
}</pre>
    <p>Here, the final string argument has been assigned the default value of "Programmer", via an
    assignment within the parameter definition. Given this, we can call EnterLogData() from within Main()
    in two manners:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****"</span>);
...
    EnterLogData(<span class="str">"Oh no! Grid can't find data"</span>);
    EnterLogData(<span class="str">"Oh no! I can't find the payroll data"</span>, <span class="str">"CFO"</span>);

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Because the first invocation of EnterLogData() did not specify a second string argument, we would
    find that the programmer is the one responsible for losing data for the grid, while the CFO misplaced the
    payroll data (as specified by the second argument in the second method call).</p>
    <p>One very important thing to be aware of, is that the value assigned to an optional parameter must be
    known at compile time, and cannot be resolved at runtime (if you attempt to do so, you'll receive
    compile time errors!). To illustrate, assume you wish to update EnterLogData() with the following extra
    optional parameter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! The default value for an optional arg must be known</span>

<span class="rem">// at compile time!</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> EnterLogData(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message,
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> owner = <span class="str">"Programmer"</span>, DateTime timeStamp = DateTime.Now)
{
    Console.Beep();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Error: {0}"</span>, message);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Owner of Error: {0}"</span>, owner);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Time of Error: {0}"</span>, timeStamp);
}</pre>
    <p>This will not compile, as the value of the Now property of the DateTime class is resolved at runtime,
    not compile time.</p>
    <p><b>Note </b>To avoid ambiguity, optional parameters must always be packed onto the end of a method signature. It is
    a compiler error to have optional parameters listed before non-optional parameters.</p>
    <h2>Invoking Methods using Named Parameters</h2>
     <p>Another new language feature added to C# with the release of .NET 4.0 is support for named arguments.
    To be honest, at first glance, this language construct may appear to do little more than result in
    confusing code. And to continue being completely honest, this could be the case! Much like optional
    arguments, including support for named parameters are largely motivated by the desire to simplify the
    process of working with the COM interoperability layer.</p>
    <p>Named arguments allow you to invoke a method by specifying parameter values in any order you
    choose. Thus, rather than passing parameters solely by position (as you will do in most cases), you can
    choose to specify each argument by name using a colon operator. To illustrate the use of named
    arguments, assume we have added the following method to the Program class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayFancyMessage(ConsoleColor textColor,
    ConsoleColor backgroundColor, <span class="kwrd">string</span> message)
{
    <span class="rem">// Store old colors to restore once message is printed.</span>
    ConsoleColor oldTextColor = Console.ForegroundColor;
    ConsoleColor oldbackgroundColor = Console.BackgroundColor;

    <span class="rem">// Set new colors and print message.</span>
    Console.ForegroundColor = textColor;
    Console.BackgroundColor = backgroundColor;

    Console.WriteLine(message);

    <span class="rem">// Restore previous colors.</span>
    Console.ForegroundColor = oldTextColor;
    Console.BackgroundColor = oldbackgroundColor;
}</pre>
    <p>Now, the way DisplayFancyMessage() was written, you would expect the caller to invoke this method
    by passing two ConsoleColor variables followed by a string type. However, using named arguments, the
    following calls are completely fine:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Methods *****"</span>);
...
    DisplayFancyMessage(message: <span class="str">"Wow! Very Fancy indeed!"</span>,
        textColor: ConsoleColor.DarkRed,
        backgroundColor: ConsoleColor.White);
    
    DisplayFancyMessage(backgroundColor: ConsoleColor.Green,
        message: <span class="str">"Testing..."</span>,
        textColor: ConsoleColor.DarkBlue);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>One minor gotcha regarding named arguments is that if you begin to invoke a method using
    positional parameters, they must be listed before any named parameters. In other words, named
    arguments must always be packed onto the end of a method call. The following code is an example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This is OK, as positional args are listed before named args.</span>
DisplayFancyMessage(ConsoleColor.Blue,
    message: <span class="str">"Testing..."</span>,
    backgroundColor: ConsoleColor.White);

<span class="rem">// This is an ERROR, as positional args are listed after named args.</span>
DisplayFancyMessage(message: <span class="str">"Testing..."</span>,
    backgroundColor: ConsoleColor.White,
    ConsoleColor.Blue);</pre>
    <p>This restriction aside, you might still be wondering when you would ever want to use this language
    feature. After all, if you need to specify three arguments to a method, why bother flipping around their
    position?</p>
    <p>Well, as it turns out, if you have a method that defines optional arguments, this feature can actually
    be really helpful. Assume DisplayFancyMessage() has been rewritten to now support optional
    arguments, as you have assigned fitting defaults:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayFancyMessage(ConsoleColor textColor = ConsoleColor.Blue,
    ConsoleColor backgroundColor = ConsoleColor.White,
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> message = <span class="str">"Test Message"</span>)
{
    ...
}</pre>
    <p>Given that each argument has a default value, named arguments allows the caller to only specify the
    parameter(s) for which they do not wish to receive the defaults. Therefore, if the caller wants the value
    "Hello!" to appear in blue text surrounded by a white background, they can simply say:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
DisplayFancyMessage(message: <span class="str">"Hello!"</span>);</pre>
    <p>Or, if the caller wants to see "Test Message" print out with a green background containing blue text,
    they can invoke DisplayFancyMessage():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
DisplayFancyMessage(backgroundColor: ConsoleColor.Green);</pre>
    <p>As you can see, optional arguments and named parameters do tend to work hand in hand. To wrap
    up our examination of building C# methods, I need to address the topic of method overloading.</p> 
    <h2>Understanding Method Overloading</h2>
    <p>Like other modern object-oriented languages, C# allows a method to be overloaded. Simply put, when
    you define a set of identically named method that differ by the number (or type) of parameters, the
    method in question is said to be overloaded.</p>
    <p>To understand why overloading is so useful, consider life as a Visual Basic 6.0 developer. Assume
    you are using VB6 to build a set of methods that return the sum of various incoming data types
    (Integers, Doubles, and so on). Given that VB6 does not support method overloading, you would be
    required to define a unique set of methods that essentially do the same thing (return the sum of the
    arguments):</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">' VB6 code examples.</span>
<span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Function</span> AddInts(<span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> x <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Integer</span>, <span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> y <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Integer</span>) <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Integer</span>
    AddInts = x + y
<span class="kwrd">End</span> <span class="kwrd">Function</span>

<span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Function</span> AddDoubles(<span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> x <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Double</span>, <span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> y <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Double</span>) <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Double</span>
    AddDoubles = x + y
<span class="kwrd">End</span> <span class="kwrd">Function</span>

<span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Function</span> AddLongs(<span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> x <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Long</span>, <span class="kwrd">ByVal</span> y <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Long</span>) <span class="kwrd">As</span> <span class="kwrd">Long</span>
    AddLongs = x + y
<span class="kwrd">End</span> Function</pre>
    <p>Not only can code such as this become tough to maintain, but the caller must now be painfully
    aware of the name of each method. Using overloading, you are able to allow the caller to call a single
    method named Add(). Again, the key is to ensure that each version of the method has a distinct set of
    arguments (methods differing only by return type are not unique enough).</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> As explained in Chapter 10, it is possible to build generic methods that take the concept of overloading to
    the next level. Using generics, you can define "placeholders" for a method implementation that are specified at the
    time you invoke the member.</p>
    <p>To check this out firsthand, create a new Console Application project named MethodOverloading.
    Now, consider the following class definition:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// C# code.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args) { }

    <span class="rem">// Overloaded Add() method.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y; }
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">double</span> x, <span class="kwrd">double</span> y)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y; }
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">long</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">long</span> x, <span class="kwrd">long</span> y)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y; }
}
</pre>
    <p>The caller can now simply invoke Add() with the required arguments and the compiler is happy to
    comply, given the fact that the compiler is able to resolve the correct implementation to invoke given the
    provided arguments:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Method Overloading *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Calls int version of Add()</span>
    Console.WriteLine(Add(10, 10));

    <span class="rem">// Calls long version of Add()</span>
    Console.WriteLine(Add(900000000000, 900000000000));

    <span class="rem">// Calls double version of Add()</span>
    Console.WriteLine(Add(4.3, 4.4));

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>The Visual Studio 2010 IDE provides assistance when calling overloaded methods to boot. When
    you type in the name of an overloaded method (such as our good friend Console.WriteLine()),
    IntelliSense will list each version of the method in question. Note that you are able to cycle through each
    version of an overloaded method using the up and down arrow keys shown in Figure 4-1.</p>

    <p><b>Figure 4-1.</b> Visual Studio IntelliSense for overloaded methods</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The MethodOverloading application is located under the Chapter 4 subdirectory.</p>
    <p>That wraps up our initial examination of building methods using the syntax of C#. Next, let's check
    out how to build and manipulate arrays, enumerations, and structures. After this point, we will wrap up
    the chapter with an examination of 'nullable data types' and the C# ? and ?? operators.</p>
