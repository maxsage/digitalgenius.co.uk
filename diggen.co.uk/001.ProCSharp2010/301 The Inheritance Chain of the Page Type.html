<h1>The Inheritance Chain of the Page Type</h1>
    <p>As you have just seen, all .NET web pages eventually derive from System.Web.UI.Page. Like any base
class, this type provides a polymorphic interface to all derived types. However, the Page type is not the
only member in your inheritance hierarchy. If you were to locate the System.Web.UI.Page class (within
the System.Web.dll assembly) using the Visual Studio 2010 object browser, you would find that Page is-a
TemplateControl, which is-a Control, which is-a Object (see Figure 32-23).</p>

<p><b>Figure 32-23</b> The inheritance chain of Page</p>
<p>Each of these base classes brings a good deal of functionality to each and every *.aspx file. For the
majority of your projects, you will make use of the members defined within the Page and Control parent
classes. The functionality gained from the System. Web.UI.TemplateControl class is only of interest if you
are building custom Web Form controls or interacting with the rendering process.</p>
<p>The first parent class of interest is Page itself. Here you will find numerous properties that enable
you to interact with various web primitives such as application and session variables, the HTTP request/
response, theme support, and so forth. Table 32-4 describes some (but by no means all) of the core properties.</p>
