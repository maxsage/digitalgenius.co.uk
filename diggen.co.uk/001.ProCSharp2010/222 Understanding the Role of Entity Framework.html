<h1>Understanding the Role of Entity Framework</h1>
<p>The connected and disconnected layers of ADO.NET provide you with a fabric that lets you select, insert,
update, and delete data with connections, commands, data readers, data adapters, and DataSet objects.
While this is all well and good, these aspects of ADO.NET force you to treat the fetched data in a manner
that is tightly coupled to the physical database schema. Recall for example, that when you use the
connected layer, you typically iterate over each record by specifying column names to a data reader. On
the other hand, if you opt to use the disconnected layer, you find yourself traversing the rows and
columns collections of a DataTable object within a DataSet container.</p> 
<p>If you use the disconnected layer in conjunction with strongly typed DataSets/data adapters, you
end up with a programming abstraction that provides some helpful benefits. First, the strongly typed
DataSet class exposes table data using class properties. Second, the strongly typed table adapter
supports methods that encapsulate the construction of the underlying SQL statements. Recall the
AddRecords() method from Chapter 22:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddRecords(AutoLotDataSet.InventoryDataTable tb,
    InventoryTableAdapter dAdapt)
{
    <span class="rem">// Get a new strongly typed row from the table.</span>
    AutoLotDataSet.InventoryRow newRow = tb.NewInventoryRow();

    <span class="rem">// Fill row with some sample data.</span>
    newRow.CarID = 999;
    newRow.Color = <span class="str">"Purple"</span>;
    newRow.Make = <span class="str">"BMW"</span>;
    newRow.PetName = <span class="str">"Saku"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Insert the new row.</span>
    tb.AddInventoryRow(newRow);

    <span class="rem">// Add one more row, using overloaded Add method.</span>
    tb.AddInventoryRow(888, <span class="str">"Yugo"</span>, <span class="str">"Green"</span>, <span class="str">"Zippy"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Update database.</span>
    dAdapt.Update(tb);
}</pre>
<p>Things get even better if you combine the disconnected layer with LINQ to DataSet. In this case, you
can apply LINQ queries to your in-memory data to obtain a new result set, which you can then
optionally map to a standalone object such as a new DataTable, a List&lt;T&gt;, Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;, or array of
data, as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> BuildDataTableFromQuery(DataTable data)
{
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> cars = <span class="kwrd">from</span> car <span class="kwrd">in</span> data.AsEnumerable()
        where car.Field&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;(<span class="str">"CarID"</span>) &gt; 5 select car;

    <span class="rem">// Use this result set to build a new DataTable.</span>
    DataTable newTable = cars.CopyToDataTable();
    
    <span class="rem">// Work with DataTable...</span>
}</pre>
<p>LINQ to DataSet is useful; however, you need to remember that the target of your LINQ query is the
data returned from the database, not the database engine itself. Ideally, you could build a LINQ query
that you send directly to the database engine for processing, and get back some strongly typed data in
return (which is exactly what the ADO.NET Entity Framework lets you accomplish).</p>
<p>When you use either the connected or disconnected layer of ADO.NET, you must always be mindful
of the physical structure of the back-end database. You must know the schema of each data table, author
complex SQL queries to interact with said table data, and so forth. This can force you to author some
fairly verbose C# code because as C# itself does not speak the language of database schema directly.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the way in which a physical database is constructed (by your friendly DBA)
is squarely focused on database constructs such as foreign keys, views, and stored procedures. The
databases constructed by your friendly DBA can grow quite complex as the DBA endeavors to account
for security and scalability. This also complicates the sort of C# code you must author in order to interact
with the data store.</p>
<p>The ADO.NET Entity Framework (EF) is a programming model that attempts to lessen the gap
between database constructs and object-oriented programming constructs. Using EF, you can interact
with a relational database without ever seeing a line of SQL code (if you so choose). Rather, when you
apply LINQ queries to your strongly typed classes, the EF runtime generates proper SQL statements on
your behalf.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> LINQ to Entities is the term that describes the act of applying LINQ queries to ADO.NET EF entity objects.</p>
<p>Another possible approach: Rather than updating database data by finding a row, updating the row,
and sending the row back for processing with a batch of SQL queries, you can simply change properties
on an object and save its state. Again, the EF runtime updates the database automatically.</p>
<p>As far as Microsoft is concerned, the ADO.NET Entity Framework is a new member of the data
access family, and it is not intended to replace the connected or disconnected layers. However, once you
spend some time working with EF, you might quickly find yourself preferring this rich object model over
the more primitive world of SQL queries and row/column collections.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, chances are you will find uses for all three approaches in your .NET projects; in some
cases, the EF model might complicate your code base. For example, if you want to build an in-house
application that needs to communicate only with a single database table, you might prefer to use the
connected layer to hit a batch of related stored procedures. Larger applications can particularly benefit
from EF, especially if the development team is comfortable working with LINQ. As with any new
technology, you will need to determine how (and when) ADO.NET EF is appropriate for the task at hand.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You might recall a database programming API introduced with .NET 3.5 called LINQ to SQL. This API is
close in concept (and fairly close in terms of programming constructs) to ADO.NET EF. While LINQ to SQL is not
formally dead, the official word from those kind folks in Redmond is that you should put your efforts into EF, not
LINQ to SQL.</p>
<h2>The Role of Entities</h2>
<p>The strongly typed classes mentioned previously are called entities. Entities are a conceptual model of a
physical database that maps to your business domain. Formally speaking, this model is termed an Entity
Data Model (EDM). The EDM is a client-side set of classes that map to a physical database, but you
should understand that the entities need not map directly to the database schema in so far as naming
conventions go. You are free to restructure your entity classes to fit your needs, and the EF runtime will
map your unique names to the correct database schema.</p>
<p>For example, you might recall that you created the simple Inventory table in the AutoLot database
using the database schema shown in Figure 23-1.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_01.png" alt="Figure 23-1" />
<p><b>Figure 23-1</b> Structure of the Inventory table of the AutoLot database</p>
<p>If you were to generate an EDM for the Inventory table of the AutoLot database (you’ll see how to do
so momentarily), the entity will be called Inventory by default. However, you could rename this class to
Car and define uniquely named properties of your choosing, which will be mapped to the columns of the
Inventory table. This loose coupling means that you can shape the entities so they closely model your
business domain. Figure 23-2 shows such an entity class.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_02.png" alt="Figure 23-2" />
<p><b>Figure 23-2</b> The Car entity is a client-side reshaping of the Inventory schema</p>
<p><b>Note</b> In many cases, the client-side entity class will be identically named to the related database table.
However, remember that you can always reshape the entity to match your business situation.</p>
<p>Now, consider the following Program class, which uses the Car entity class (and a related class named
AutoLotEntities) to add a new row to the Inventory table of AutoLot. This class is termed an object
context; the job of this class it is to communicate with the physical database on your behalf (you will
learn more details soon):</p>

{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Connection string automatically read from</span>
        <span class="rem">// generated config file.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())

            <span class="rem">// Add a new record to Inventory table, using our entity.</span>
            context.Cars.AddObject(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Car() { AutoIDNumber = 987, CarColor = <span class="str">"Black"</span>,
                MakeOfCar = <span class="str">"Pinto"</span>,
                NicknameOfCar = <span class="str">"Pete"</span> });
            
            context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>It is up to the EF runtime to take the client-side representation of the Inventory table (here, a class
named Car) and map it back to the correct columns of the Inventory table. Notice that you see no trace
of any sort of SQL INSERT statement; you simply add a new Car object to the collection maintained by
the aptly named Cars property of the context object and save your changes. Sure enough, if you view the
table data using the Server Explorer of Visual Studio 2010, you will see a brand new record (see
Figure 23-3).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_03.png" alt="Figure 23-3" />
<p><b>Figure 23-3</b> The result of saving the context</p>
<p>There is no magic in the preceding example. Under the covers, a connection to the database is
made, a proper SQL statement is generated, and so forth. The benefit of EF is that these details are
handled on your behalf. Now let’s look at the core services of EF that make this possible.</p>
<h2>The Building Blocks of the Entity Framework</h2>
<p>The EF API sits on top of the existing ADO.NET infrastructure you have already examined in the previous
two chapters. Like any ADO.NET interaction, the entity framework uses an ADO.NET data provider to
communicate with the data store. However, the data provider must be updated so it supports a new set
of services before it can interact with the EF API. As you might expect, the Microsoft SQL Server data
provider has been updated with the necessary infrastructure, which is accounted for when using the
System.Data.Entity.dll assembly.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Many third party databases (e.g., Oracle and MySQL) provide EF-aware data providers. Consult your
database vendor for details or log onto www.sqlsummit.com/dataprov.htm for a list of known ADO.NET data
providers.</p>
<p>In addition to adding the necessary bits to the Microsoft SQL Server data provider, the
System.Data.Entity.dll assembly contains various namespaces that account for the EF services
themselves. The two key pieces of the EF API to concentrate on for the time being are object services and
entity client.</p>
<h2>The Role of Object Services</h2>
<p>Object services is the name given to the part of EF that manages the client-side entities as you work with
them in code. For example, object services track the changes you make to an entity (e.g., changing the
color of a car from green to blue), manage relationships between the entities (e.g., looking up all orders
for a customer named Steve Hagen), and provide ways to save your changes to the database, as well as
ways to persist the state of an entity with XML and binary serialization services.</p>
<p>Programmatically speaking, the object services layer micromanages any class that extends the
EntityObject base class. As you might suspect, EntityObject is in the inheritance chain for all entity
classes in the EF programming model. For example, if you look at the inheritance chain of the Car entity
class used in the previous example, you see that Car Is-A EntityObject (see Figure 23-4).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_04.png" alt="Figure 23-4" />
<p><b>Figure 23-4</b> EF’s object service layer can manage any class that extends EntityObject</p>
<h2>The Role of the Entity Client</h2>
<p>Another major aspect of the EF API is the entity client layer. This part of the EF API is in charge of
working with the underlying ADO.NET data provider to make connections to the database, generate the
necessary SQL statements based on the state of your entities and LINQ queries, map fetched database
data into the correct shape of your entities, and manage other details you would normally perform by
hand if you were not using the Entity Framework.</p>
<p>You can find the functionality of the entity client layer in the System.Data.EntityClient namespace.
This namespace includes a set of classes that map EF concepts (such as LINQ to Entity queries) to the
underlying ADO.NET data provider. These classes (e.g., EntityCommand and EntityConnection) are eerily
similar to the classes you find in an ADO.NET data provider; for example, Figure 23-5 illustrates how the
classes of the entity client layer extend the same abstract base classes of any other provider (e.g.,
DbCommand and DbConnection; you can also see Chapter 22 for more details on this subject).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_05.png" alt="Figure 23-5" />
<p><b>Figure 23-5</b> The entity client layer maps entity commands to the underlying ADO.NET data provider</p>
<p>The entity client layer typically works behind the scenes, but it is entirely possible to work directly
with an entity client if you require full control over how it performs its duties (most notably, how it
generates the SQL queries and handles the returned database data).</p>
<p>If you require greater control over how the entity client builds a SQL statement based on the
incoming LINQ query, you can use Entity SQL. Entity SQL is a database-independent dialect of SQL that
works directly with entities. Once you build an entity SQL query, it can be sent directly to entity client
services (or if you wish, to object services), where it will be formatted into a proper SQL statement for the
underlying data provider. You will not work with Entity SQL to any significant extent in this chapter, but
you will see a few examples of this new SQL-based grammar later in the chapter.</p>
<p>If you require greater control over how a fetched result set is manipulated, you can forego the
automatic mapping of database results to entity objects and manually process the records using the
EntityDataReader class. Unsurprisingly, the EntityDataReader allows you to process fetched data using a
forward only, read only stream of data, just as SqlDataReader does. You will see a working example of this
approach later in the chapter.</p>
<h2>The Role of the *.edmx File (and Friends)</h2>
<p>Recapping the story thus far, entities are client-side classes, which function as an Entity Data Model.
While the client side entities will eventually be mapped to the correct database table, there is no tight
coupling between the property names of your entity classes and the column names on the data table.</p>
<p>For the Entity Framework API to map entity class data to database table data correctly, you need a
proper definition of the mapping logic. In any data model-driven system, the entities, the real database,
and the mapping layers are separated into three related parts: a conceptual model, a logical model, and a
physical model.</p>
<ul>
 <li>The conceptual model defines the entities and their relationships (if any).</li>
 <li>The logical model maps the entities and relationships into tables with any required foreign key constraints.</li>
 <li>The physical model represents the capabilities of a particular data engine by specifying storage details, such table schema, partitioning, and indexing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the world of EF, each of these three layers is captured in an XML-based file format. When you use
the integrated Entity Framework designers of Visual Studio 2010, you end up with a file that takes an
*.edmx file extension (remember, EDM = entity data model). This file includes XML descriptions of the
entities, the physical database, and instructions on how to map this information between the conceptual
and physical models. You will examine the format of the *.edmx file in the first example of this chapter
(which you will see in a moment).</p>
<p>When you compile your EF-based projects using Visual Studio 2010, the *.edmx file is used to
generate three standalone XML files: one for the conceptual model data (*.csdl), one for the physical
model (*.ssdl), and one for the mapping layer (*.msl). The data of these three XML-based files is then
bundled into your application in the form of binary resources. Once compiled, your .NET assembly has
all the necessary data for the EF API calls you make in your code base.</p>
<h2>The Role of the ObjectContext and ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; Classes</h2>
<p>The final part of the EF puzzle is the ObjectContext class, which is a member of the System.Data.Objects
namespace. When you generate your *.edmx file, you get the entity classes that map to the database
tables and a class that extends ObjectContext. You typically use this class to interact with object services
and entity client functionality indirectly.</p>
<p>ObjectContext provides a number of core services to child classes, including the ability to save all
changes (which results in a database update), tweak the connection string, delete objects, call stored
procedures, and handle other fundamental details. Table 23-1 describes some of the core members of
the ObjectContext class (be aware that a majority of these members stay in memory until you call
SaveChanges()).</p>
<p><b>Table 23-1.</b> Common Members of ObjectContext</p>

  <tr>
   <td>
    SavingChanges
   </td>
   <td>
    This event fires when the object context saves changes to

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The ObjectContext derived class serves as a container that manages entity objects, which are stored
in a collection of type ObjectSet&lt;T&gt;. For example, if you generate an *.edmx file for the Inventory table of
the AutoLot database, you end up with a class named (by default) AutoLotEntities. This class supports a
property named Inventories (note the plural name) that encapsulates an ObjectSet&lt;Inventory&gt; data
member. If you create an EDM for the Orders table of the AutoLot database, the AutoLotEntities class
will define a second property named Orders that encapsulates an ObjectSet&lt;Order&gt; member variable.
Table 23-2 defines some common members of System.Data.Objects.ObjectSet&lt;T&gt;.</p>
<p><b>Table 23-2.</b> Common members of ObjectSet&lt;T&gt;</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>

  <tr>
   <td>

   </td>
   <td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    DeleteObject
   </td>
   <td>
    Marks an object for deletion.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Once you drill into the correct property of the object context, you can call any member of
ObjectSet&lt;T&gt;. Consider again the sample code shown in the first few pages of this chapter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
{
    <span class="rem">// Add a new record to Inventory table, using our entity.</span>
    context.Cars.AddObject(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Car() { AutoIDNumber = 987, CarColor = <span class="str">"Black"</span>,
        MakeOfCar = <span class="str">"Pinto"</span>,
        NicknameOfCar = <span class="str">"Pete"</span> });

    context.SaveChanges();
}</pre>
<p>Here, AutoLotEntities is-a ObjectContext. The Cars property gives you access to the ObjectSet&lt;Car&gt;
variable. You use this reference to insert a new Car entity object and tell the ObjectContext to save all
changes to the database.</p>
<p>ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; is typically the target of LINQ to Entity queries; as such, ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; supports the
same extension methods you learned about in Chapter 13. Moreover, ObjectSet&lt;T&gt; gains a good deal of
functionality from its direct parent class, ObjectQuery&lt;T&gt;, which is a class that represents a strongly
typed LINQ (or Entity SQL) query.</p>
<h2>All Together Now!</h2>
<p>Before you build your first Entity Framework example, take a moment to ponder Figure 23-6, which
shows you how the EF API is organized.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_06.png" alt="Figure 23-6" />
<p><b>Figure 23-6</b> The major components of the ADO.NET Entity Framework</p>
<p>The moving parts illustrated by Figure 23-6 are not as complex as they might seem at first glance.
For example, consider this common scenario. You author some C# code that applies a LINQ query to an
entity you received from your context. This query is passed into object services, where it formats the
LINQ command into a tree entity client can understand. In turn, the entity client formats this tree into a
proper SQL statement for the underlying ADO.NET provider. The provider returns a data reader (e.g., a
DbDataReader derived object) that client services use to stream data to object services using an
EntiryDataReader. What your C# code base gets back is an enumeration of entity data (IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;).</p>
<p>Here is another scenario to consider. Your C# code base wants more control over how client services
constructs the eventual SQL statement to send to the database. Thus, you author some C# code using
Entity SQL that can be passed directly to entity client or object services. The end result returns as an
IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.</p>
<p>In either of these scenarios, you must make the XML data of the *.edmx file known to client services;
this enables it to understand how to map database atoms to entities. Finally, remember that the client
(e.g., your C# code base) can also nab the results sent from entity client by using the EntityDataReader
directly.</p>
