    <h1>The Basic Mechanics of Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Recall from the previous chapter that inheritance is the aspect of OOP that facilitates code reuse.
    Specifically speaking, code reuse comes in two flavors: inheritance (the "is-a" relationship) and the
    containment/delegation model (the "has-a" relationship). Let's begin this chapter by examining the
    classical "is-a" inheritance model.</p>
    <p>When you establish "is-a" relationships between classes, you are building a dependency between
    two or more class types. The basic idea behind classical inheritance is that new classes can be created
    using existing classes as a starting point. To begin with a very simple example, create a new Console
    Application project named BasicInheritance. Now assume you have designed a class named Car that
    models some basic details of an automobile:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A simple base class.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> maxSpeed;
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> currSpeed;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car(<span class="kwrd">int</span> max)
    {
        maxSpeed = max;
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Car()
    {
        maxSpeed = 55;
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Speed
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> currSpeed; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span>
        {
            currSpeed = value;
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (currSpeed &gt; maxSpeed)
            {
                currSpeed = maxSpeed;
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that the Car class is making use of encapsulation services to control access to the private
    currSpeed field using a public property named Speed. At this point, you can exercise your Car type as
    follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Basic Inheritance *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="rem">// Make a Car object and set max speed.</span>
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(80);

    <span class="rem">// Set the current speed, and print it.</span>
    myCar.Speed = 50;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"My car is going {0} MPH"</span>, myCar.Speed);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <h2>Specifying the Parent Class of an Existing Class</h2>
    <p>Now assume you wish to build a new class named MiniVan. Like a basic Car, you wish to define the
    MiniVan class to support a maximum speed, current speed, and a property named Speed to allow the
    object user to modify the object's state. Clearly, the Car and MiniVan classes are related; in fact, it can be
    said that a MiniVan "is-a" Car. The "is-a" relationship (formally termed classical inheritance) allows you
    to build new class definitions that extend the functionality of an existing class.</p>
    <p>The existing class that will serve as the basis for the new class is termed a base or parent class. The
    role of a base class is to define all the common data and members for the classes that extend it. The
    extending classes are formally termed derived or child classes. In C#, you make use of the colon operator
    on the class definition to establish an "is-a" relationship between classes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// MiniVan 'is-a' Car.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MiniVan : Car
{
}</pre>
    <p>What have you gained by extending your MiniVan from the Car base class? Simply put, MiniVan
    objects now have access to each public member defined within the parent class.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> Although constructors are typically defined as public, a derived class never inherits the constructors of a
    parent class.</p>
<p>Given the relation between these two class types, you could now make use of the MiniVan class like
so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Basic Inheritance *****\n"</span>);
...
    <span class="rem">// Now make a MiniVan object.</span>
    MiniVan myVan = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MiniVan();
    myVan.Speed = 10;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"My van is going {0} MPH"</span>,
        myVan.Speed);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that although you have not added any members to the MiniVan class, you have direct access
    to the public Speed property of your parent class, and have thus reused code. This is a far better
    approach than creating a MiniVan class that has the exact same members as Car such as a Speed property.
    If you did duplicate code between these two classes, you would need to now maintain two bodies of
    code, which is certainly a poor use of your time.</p>
    <p>Always remember, that inheritance preserves encapsulation; therefore, the following code results in
    a compiler error, as private members can never be accessed from an object reference.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Basic Inheritance *****\n"</span>);
...
    <span class="rem">// Make a MiniVan object.</span>
    MiniVan myVan = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MiniVan();
    myVan.Speed = 10;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"My van is going {0} MPH"</span>,
        myVan.Speed);

    <span class="rem">// Error! Can't access private members!</span>
    myVan.currSpeed = 55;
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>On a related note, if the MiniVan defined its own set of members, it would not be able to access any
    private member of the Car base class. Again, private members can only be accessed by the class that
    defines it.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// MiniVan derives from Car.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MiniVan : Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> TestMethod()
    {
        <span class="rem">// OK! Can access public members</span>
        <span class="rem">// of a parent within a derived type.</span>
        Speed = 10;

        <span class="rem">// Error! Cannot access private</span>
        <span class="rem">// members of parent within a derived type.</span>
        currSpeed = 10;
    }
}</pre>
    <h2>Regarding Multiple Base Classes</h2>
    <p>Speaking of base classes, it is important to keep in mind that C# demands that a given class have exactly
    one direct base class. It is not possible to create a class type that directly derives from two or more base
    classes (this technique [which is supported in unmanaged C++] is known as multiple inheritance, or
    simply MI). If you attempted to create a class that specifies two direct parent classes as shown in the
    following code, you will receive compiler errors.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Illegal! The .NET platform does not allow</span>
<span class="rem">// multiple inheritance for classes!</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> WontWork
    : BaseClassOne, BaseClassTwo
{}</pre>
    <p>As examined in Chapter 9, the .NET platform does allow a given class, or structure, to implement
    any number of discrete interfaces. In this way, a C# type can exhibit a number of behaviors while
    avoiding the complexities associated with MI. On a related note, while a class can have only one direct
    base class, it is permissible for an interface to directly derive from multiple interfaces. Using this
    technique, you can build sophisticated interface hierarchies that model complex behaviors.</p> 
    <h2>The sealed Keyword</h2>
    <p>C# supplies another keyword, sealed, that prevents inheritance from occurring. When you mark a class
    as sealed, the compiler will not allow you to derive from this type. For example, assume you have
    decided that it makes no sense to further extend the MiniVan class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The MiniVan class cannot be extended!</span>
<span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MiniVan : Car
{
}</pre>
    <p>If you (or a teammate) were to attempt to derive from this class, you would receive a compile-time
    error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! Cannot extend</span>
<span class="rem">// a class marked with the sealed keyword!</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> DeluxeMiniVan
    : MiniVan
{}</pre>
    <p>Most often, sealing a class makes the best sense when you are designing a utility class. For example,
    the System namespace defines numerous sealed classes. You can verify this for yourself by opening up
    the Visual Studio 2010 Object Browser (via the View menu) and selecting the String class within the
    System namespace of the mscorlib.dll assembly. Notice in Figure 6-1 the use of the sealed keyword
    seen within the Summary window.</p>
    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_01.png" alt="Figure 6-1" />
    <p><b>Figure 6-1. </b>The base class libraries define numerous sealed types.</p>
    <p>Thus, just like the MiniVan, if you attempted to build a new class that extends System.String, you will
    receive a compile-time error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Another error! Cannot extend</span>
<span class="rem">// a class marked as sealed!</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyString
    : String
{}</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> Structures are always implicitly sealed. Therefore, you
    can never derive one structure from another structure, a class from a structure or a structure from a class.
    Structures can only be used to model standalone, atomic, user defined-data types. If you wish to leverage the Is-A
    relationship, you must use classes.</p>
    <p>As you would guess, there are many more details to inheritance that you will come to know during
    the remainder of this chapter. For now, simply keep in mind that the colon operator allows you to
    establish base/derived class relationships, while the sealed keyword prevents subsequent inheritance
    from occurring.</p>
