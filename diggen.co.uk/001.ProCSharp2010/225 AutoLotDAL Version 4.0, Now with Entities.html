<h1>AutoLotDAL Version 4.0, Now with Entities</h1>
  <p>Next, you will learn how to build an EDM that captures the bulk of the AutoLot database, including your
GetPetName stored procedure. I strongly suggest that you make a copy of the AutoLotDAL (Version 3)
project you created in Chapter 22 and rename this copy to AutoLotDAL (Version 4).</p>
<p>Open the latest version of the AutoLotDAL project in Visual Studio 2010 and insert a new ADO.NET
Entity Data Model project item named AutoLotDAL_EF.edmx. On step three of the wizard, you should
select the Inventory, Orders, and Customers tables (there’s no need to nab the CreditRisks table at this
time), as well as the custom stored procedure (see Figure 23-17).</p>

<p><b>Figure 23-17</b> The *.edmx file for a majority of the AutoLot database</p>
<p>In contrast to the first EDM example, this time you don’t bother renaming your entity class names
or their properties.</p>
<h2>Mapping the Stored Procedure</h2>
<p>Here’s one aspect of the EDM Wizard that is quite odd: even when you check off the name of a stored
procedure to include in your conceptual model, your work is not done. At this point all you have done is
make the IDE aware of the physical stored procedure; to make it materialize in code, you need to import
the function into the conceptual layer. Open the Model browser (using the View &gt; Other Windows &gt;
Entity Data Model Browser menu) and notice that you can see GetPetName in the physical database
(located under AutoLotModel.Store); however, the Function Imports folder (highlighted in Figure 23-18)
is currently empty.</p>

<p><b>Figure 23-18</b> Stored procedures must be imported before you can call them!</p>
<p>You can begin mapping this to your conceptual layer by right-clicking on the Function Imports
folder and selecting the Add Function Import... menu option (see Figure 23-19).</p>

<p><b>Figure 23-19</b> Choosing to import a stored procedure into your conceptual model</p>
<p>In the resulting dialog box, you want to pick the name of the physical stored procedure (from the
Stored Procedure Name dropdown box), and then supply a name of the method to map to in your
conceptual model. In this case, the names will map directly. Now recall that your stored procedure does
not literally return a set of records; however, it does return an output parameter. Thus, you need to make
sure that you check the None radio button (see Figure 23-20).</p>

<h2>The Role of Navigation Properties</h2>
<p>If you look at the EDM designer now, you will see each table is accounted for, including new entries in
the Navigation Properties section of a given entity class (see Figure 23-21).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_21.png" alt="Figure 23-21" />
<p><b>Figure 23-21</b> Navigation properties</p>
<p>As the name suggests, navigation properties allow you to capture JOIN operations in the Entity
Framework programming model (without the need to author complex SQL statements). To account for
these foreign key relationships, each entity in the *.edmx file now contains some new XML data that
shows how entities are connected through key data. Feel free to open the *.edmx file using the XML
editor if you wish to see the markup directly; however, you can see this same information in the Model
Browser window, under the Associations folder (see Figure 23-22).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_22.png" alt="Figure 23-22" />
<p><b>Figure 23-22</b> Viewing your entity relationships</p>
<p>If you wish, change the version number of this new library to 4.0.0.0 (using the Assembly
Information button within Applications tab of Properties window). Now compile your modified
AutoLot.dll assembly before moving to the first client application.</p>
<h2>Using Navigation Properties within LINQ to Entity Queries</h2>
<p>Next, you will learn how to use these navigation properties within the context of LINQ to Entity queries
(you could also use them with Entity SQL; however, this book doesn’t delve into that aspect of this topic.
Before you bind your data to a Windows Forms GUI, you make one final Console Application named
AutoLotEDMClient. Once you create the project, set a reference to System.Data.Entity.dll and the latest
and greatest version of AutoLotDAL.dll.</p>
<p>Next, insert the App.config file from your AutoLotDAL project (using the Project &gt; Add Existing Item
menu option) and import the AutoLotDAL namespace. Recall that the App.Config file generated by the
EDM tools defines the correct connection string required by the Entity Framework.</p>
<p>Next, you will update the physical Orders table with a few new records. Specifically, you want to
ensure that a single customer has multiple orders. Using the Visual Studio 2010 Server Explorer, update
the Orders table with one or two new records to ensure that a single customer has two or more orders.
For example, in Figure 23-23, customer #4 has two pending orders, for cars #1992 and #83.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure23_23.png" alt="Figure 23-23" />
<p><b>Figure 23-23</b> A single customer with multiple orders</p>
<p>Now update your Program with a new helper method (called from Main()). This method uses the
navigation properties to select each Inventory object on order for a given customer:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> PrintCustomerOrders(<span class="kwrd">string</span> custID)
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> id = <span class="kwrd">int</span>.Parse(custID);

    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> carsOnOrder = <span class="kwrd">from</span> o <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Orders
            where o.CustID == id select o.Inventory;
        
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"\nCustomer has {0} orders pending:"</span>, carsOnOrder.Count());
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> carsOnOrder)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; {0} {1} named {2}."</span>,
                item.Color, item.Make, item.PetName);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>When you run your application, you see something similar to the following output (notice that you
specify a customer ID of four when you call PrintCustomerOrders() from Main()):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Navigation Properties *****
Please enter customer ID: 4

Customer has 2 orders pending:
-&gt; Pink Saab named Pinky.
-&gt; Rust Ford named Rusty.</pre>
<p>Here, you find a single Customer entity in the context, which has the specified CustID value. Once
you find the given customer, you can navigate to the Inventory table to select each car on order. The
return value of your LINQ query is an enumeration of Inventory objects, which you print out using a
standard foreach loop.</p>
<h2>Invoking a Stored Procedure</h2>
<p>In the AutoLotDAL EMD, you now have the information you need to invoke the GetPetName stored
procedure. You can do this using either of two approaches:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> CallStoredProc()
{
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        ObjectParameter input = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObjectParameter(<span class="str">"carID"</span>, 83);
        ObjectParameter output = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObjectParameter(<span class="str">"petName"</span>, <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>));

        <span class="rem">// Call ExecuteFunction off the context....</span>
        context.ExecuteFunction(<span class="str">"GetPetName"</span>, input, output);

        <span class="rem">// ....or use the strongly typed method on the context.</span>
        context.GetPetName(83, output);

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Car #83 is named {0}"</span>, output.Value);
    }
}</pre>
<p>The first approach is to call the ExecuteFunction() method of your object context. In this case, the
stored procedure is identified by a string name, and each parameter is represented by an object of type
ObjectParameter, which is in the System.Data.Objects namespace (don’t forget to import this into your
C# code file!).</p>
<p>The second approach is to use the strongly typed name in your object context. This approach proves
a tad simpler because you can send input parameters (such as the car ID) as typed data, rather than as
an ObjectParameter object.</p>
