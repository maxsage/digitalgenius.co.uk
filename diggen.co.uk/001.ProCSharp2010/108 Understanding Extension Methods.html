<h1>Understanding Extension Methods</h1>
  <p>.NET 3.5 introduced the concept of extension methods, which allow you to tack on new functionality to
precompiled types on the fly. As you know, once a type is defined and compiled into a .NET assembly, its
definition is, more or less, final. The only way to add new members, update members, or remove
members is to recode and recompile the code base into an updated assembly (or take more drastic
measures, such as using the System.Reflection.Emit namespace to dynamically reshape a compiled
type in memory).</p>
<p>In C#, it is now possible to define extension methods. In a nutshell, extension methods allow
existing compiled types (specifically, classes, structures, or interface implementations) as well as types
currently being compiled (such as types in a project that contains extension methods) to gain new
functionality without needing to directly update the type being extended.</p>
<p>This technique can be quite helpful when you need to inject new functionality into types for which
you do not have an existing code base. It can also be handy when you need to force a type to support a
set of members (in the interest of polymorphism), but cannot modify the original type declaration.
Using extension methods, you can add functionality to precompiled types while providing the illusion
these methods were there all along.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Understand that extension methods do not literally change the compiled code base! This technique only
adds members to a type within the context of the current application.</p>
<p>When you define extension methods, the first restriction is that they must be defined within a static
class (see Chapter 5), and therefore each extension method must be declared with the static keyword.
The second point is that all extension methods are marked as such by using the this keyword as a
modifier on the first (and only the first) parameter of the method in question. The third point is that
every extension method can be called either from the correct instance in memory or statically via the
defining static class! Sound strange? Let’s look at a full example to clarify matters.</p>
<h2>Defining Extension Methods</h2>
  <p>Create a new Console Application named ExtensionMethods. Now, assume you are authoring a utility
class named MyExtensions that defines two extension methods. The first method allows any object in the
.NET base class libraries to have a brand-new method named DisplayDefiningAssembly() that makes
use of types in the System.Reflection namespace to display the assembly of the specified type.</p>
<p><b>Note </b>You will formally examine the reflection API in Chapter 15. If you are new to the topic, simply understand
that reflection allows you to discover the structure of assemblies, types, and type members at runtime.</p>
  <p>The second extension method, named ReverseDigits(), allows any System.Int32 to obtain a new
version of itself where the value is reversed digit by digit. For example, if an integer with the value 1234
called ReverseDigits(), the integer returned is set to the value 4321. Consider the following class
implementation (be sure to import the System.Reflection namespace if you are following along):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyExtensions
{
    <span class="rem">// This method allows any object to display the assembly</span>
    <span class="rem">// it is defined in.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayDefiningAssembly(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} lives here: =&gt; {1}\n"</span>, obj.GetType().Name,
            Assembly.GetAssembly(obj.GetType()).GetName().Name);
    }

    <span class="rem">// This method allows any integer to reverse its digits.</span>
    <span class="rem">// For example, 56 would return 65.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> ReverseDigits(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> i)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Translate int into a string, and then</span>
        <span class="rem">// get all the characters.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">char</span>[] digits = i.ToString().ToCharArray();

        <span class="rem">// Now reverse items in the array.</span>
        Array.Reverse(digits);
    
        <span class="rem">// Put back into string.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> newDigits = <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>(digits);

        <span class="rem">// Finally, return the modified string back as an int.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span>.Parse(newDigits);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Again, note how the first parameter of each extension method has been qualified with the this
keyword, before defining the parameter type. It is always the case that the first parameter of an extension
method represents the type being extended. Given that DisplayDefiningAssembly() has been prototyped
to extend System.Object, any type in any assembly now has this new member. However,
ReverseDigits() has been prototyped to only extend integer types, and therefore if anything other than
an integer attempts to invoke this method, you will receive a compile-time error.</p>
<p>Understand that a given extension method can have multiple parameters, but only the first
parameter can be qualified with this. For example, here is an overloaded extension method defined in
another utility class named TesterUtilClass:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> TesterUtilClass
{
    <span class="rem">// Every Int32 now has a Foo() method...</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Foo(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> i)
    { Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} called the Foo() method."</span>, i); }

    <span class="rem">// ...which has been overloaded to take a string!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Foo(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> i, <span class="kwrd">string</span> msg)
    { Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} called Foo() and told me: {1}"</span>, i, msg); }
}</pre>
<h2>Invoking Extension Methods on an Instance Level</h2>
  <p>Now that we have these extension methods, look at how all objects (which of course means everything in
the .NET base class libraries) have a new method named DisplayDefiningAssembly(), while
System.Int32 types (and only integers) have methods named ReverseDigits() and Foo():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Extension Methods *****\n"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// The int has assumed a new identity!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 12345678;
    myInt.DisplayDefiningAssembly();
    
    <span class="rem">// So has the DataSet!</span>
    System.Data.DataSet d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> System.Data.DataSet();
    d.DisplayDefiningAssembly();
    
    <span class="rem">// And the SoundPlayer!</span>
    System.Media.SoundPlayer sp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> System.Media.SoundPlayer();
    sp.DisplayDefiningAssembly();
    
    <span class="rem">// Use new integer functionality.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Value of myInt: {0}"</span>, myInt);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Reversed digits of myInt: {0}"</span>, myInt.ReverseDigits());
    myInt.Foo();
    myInt.Foo(<span class="str">"Ints that Foo? Who would have thought it!"</span>);
    
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> b2 = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    
    <span class="rem">// Error! Booleans don't have the Foo() method!</span>
    <span class="rem">// b2.Foo();</span>
    
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Here is the output.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Extension Methods *****

Int32 lives here: => mscorlib

DataSet lives here: => System.Data

12345678 called the Foo() method.
12345678 called Foo() and told me: Ints that Foo? Who would have thought it!</pre>
<h2>Invoking Extension Methods Statically</h2>
  <p>Recall that the first parameter of an extension method is marked with the this keyword, followed by the
type of item the method is applicable to. If you peek at what is happening behind the scenes (as verified
by a tool such as ildasm.exe), you will find that the compiler simply calls the “normal” static method,
passing in the variable calling the method as a parameter (e.g., it is the value of this). Consider the
following C# code, which approximates the code substitution that took place:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Extension Methods *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 12345678;
    MyExtensions.DisplayDefiningAssembly(myInt);
    
    System.Data.DataSet d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DataSet();
    MyExtensions.DisplayDefiningAssembly(d);
    
    System.Media.SoundPlayer sp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SoundPlayer();
    MyExtensions.DisplayDefiningAssembly(sp);
    
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Value of myInt: {0}"</span>, myInt);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Reversed digits of myInt: {0}"</span>,
        MyExtensions.ReverseDigits(myInt));
    
    TesterUtilClass.Foo(myInt);
    TesterUtilClass.Foo(myInt, <span class="str">"Ints that Foo? Who would have thought it!"</span>);
    
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Given that calling an extension method from an object (thereby making it seem that the method is
in fact an instance-level method) is just some smoke-and-mirrors effect provided by the compiler, you
are always free to call extension methods as normal static methods using the expected C# syntax (as just
shown).</p>
<h2>The Scope of an Extension Method</h2>
  <p>As just explained, extension methods are essentially static methods that can be invoked from an instance
of the extended type. Given this flavor of syntactic sugar, it is really important to point out that unlike a
“normal” method, extension methods do not have direct access to the members of the type they are
extending; said another way, extending is not inheriting. Consider the following simple Car type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Speed;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> SpeedUp()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> ++Speed;
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you were to build an extension method for the Car type named SlowDown(), you would not have
direct access to the members of Car within the scope of the extension method as this is not classical
inheritance. Therefore, the following would result in a compiler error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarExtensions
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> SlowDown(<span class="kwrd">this</span> Car c)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Error! This method is not deriving from Car!</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> --Speed;
    }    
}</pre>
<p>The problem here is that the static SlowDown() extension method is attempting to access the Speed
field of the Car type. However, because SlowDown() is a static member of the CarExtensions class, Speed
does not exist in this context! What is permissible, however, is to make use of the this-qualified
parameter to access all public members (and only the public members) of the type being extending.
Thus, the following code compiles as expected:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarExtensions
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> SlowDown(<span class="kwrd">this</span> Car c)
    {
        <span class="rem">// OK!</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> --c.Speed;
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you could create a Car object and invoke the SpeedUp() and SlowDown() methods as
follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UseCar()
{
    Car c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Speed: {0}"</span>, c.SpeedUp());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Speed: {0}"</span>, c.SlowDown());
}</pre>
<h2>Importing Types That Define Extension Methods</h2>
  <p>When you partition a set of static classes containing extension methods in a unique namespace, other
namespaces in that assembly will make use of the standard C# using keyword to import not only the
static classes themselves, but also each of the supported extension methods. This is important to
remember, because if you do not explicitly import the correct namespace, the extension methods are
not available for that C# code file.</p>
<p>In effect, although it can appear on the surface that extension methods are global in nature, they are
in fact limited to the namespaces that define them or the namespaces that import them. Thus, if we
wrap the definitions of our static classes (MyExtensions, TesterUtilClass, and CarExtensions) into a
namespace named MyExtensionMethods as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MyExtensionMethods
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyExtensions
    {
        ...
    }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> TesterUtilClass
    {
        ...
    }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> CarExtensions
    {
        ...
    }
}</pre>
<p>other namespaces in the project would need to explicitly import the MyExtensionMethods namespace to
gain the extension methods defined by these types. Therefore, the following is a compiler error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Here is our only using directive.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MyNewApp
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> JustATest
    {    
        <span class="kwrd">void</span> SomeMethod()
        {
            <span class="rem">// Error! Need to import MyExtensionMethods</span>
            <span class="rem">// namespace to extend int with Foo()!</span>
            <span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0;
            i.Foo();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<h2>The IntelliSense of Extension Methods</h2>
  <p>Given the fact that extension methods are not literally defined on the type being extended, it is certainly
possible to become confused when examining an existing code base. For example, assume you have
imported a namespace that defined some number of extension methods authored by a teammate. As
you are authoring your code, you might create a variable of the extended type, apply the dot operator,
and find dozens of new methods that are not members of the original class definition!</p>
<p>Thankfully, Visual Studio’s IntelliSense mechanism marks all extension methods with a unique,
blue down-arrow icon (see Figure 12-5).</p>
<p><b>Figure 12-5. </b>The IntelliSense of extension methods</p>
<p>Any method marked with this visual icon is a friendly reminder that the method is defined outside
of the original class definition via an extension method.</p>
<h2>Building and Using Extension Libraries</h2>
  <p>The previous example extended the functionality of various types (such as the System.Int32 type) for use
by the current console application. However, I am sure you can imagine the usefulness of building
a.NET code library that defines extensions that can be referenced by multiple applications. As luck
would have it, doing so is very straightforward.</p>
<p>Chapter 14 will delve into the details of creating and configuring custom libraries; however, if you
wish to follow along for this example, create a new Class Library project named MyExtensionsLibrary.
Next, rename your initial C# code file to MyExtensions.cs and copy the MyExtensions class definition in
your new namespace:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MyExtensionsLibrary
{
    <span class="rem">// Be sure to import System.Reflection.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyExtensions
    {
        <span class="rem">// Same implementation as before.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayDefiningAssembly(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
        {...}

        <span class="rem">// Same implementation as before.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> ReverseDigits(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> i)
        {...}
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note </b>If you wish to export extension methods from a .NET code library, the defining type must be declared with
the public keyword (recall that the default access modifier for a type is internal).</p>
<p>At this point, you can compile your library and reference the MyExtensionsLibrary.dll assembly
within new .NET projects. When you do so, the new functionality provided to System.Object and
System.Int32 can be used by any application that references the library.</p>
<p>To test this out, add a new Console Application project (named MyExtensionsLibraryClient). Next,
add a reference to the MyExtensionsLibrary.dll assembly. Within the initial code file, specify that you
are using the MyExtensionsLibrary namespace and author some simple code that invokes these new
methods on a local integer:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;

<span class="rem">// Import our custom namespace.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> MyExtensionsLibrary;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MyExtensionsLibraryClient
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Using Library with Extensions *****\n"</span>);
            <span class="rem">// This time, these extension methods</span>
            <span class="rem">// have been defined within an external</span>
            <span class="rem">// .NET class library.</span>
            <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 987;
            myInt.DisplayDefiningAssembly();
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} is reversed to {1}"</span>,
                myInt, myInt.ReverseDigits());
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Microsoft recommends placing types that have extension methods in a dedicated assembly (within
a dedicated namespace). The reason is simply to reduce cluttering of your programming environment.
By way of example, if you were to author a core library for your company that every application was
expected to make use of, and if the root namespace of that library defined 30 extension methods, the end
result would be that all applications would see these methods pop up in IntelliSense (even if they are not
required).</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The MyExtensionsLibrary and MyExtensionsLibraryClient projects can be found under the Chapter
12 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>Extending Interface Types via Extension Methods</h2>
  <p>At this point, you have seen how to extend classes (and, indirectly, structures that follow the same
syntax) with new functionality via extension methods. To wrap up our investigation of C# extension
methods, allow me to point out that it is possible to extend an interface type with new methods;
however, the semantics of such an action are sure to be a bit different from what you might expect.</p>
<p>Create a new Console Application named InterfaceExtensions and define a simple interface type
(IBasicMath) that contains a single method named Add(). Next, implement this interface on a class type
(MyCalc) in a fitting manner, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Define a normal interface in C#.</span>
<span class="kwrd">interface</span> IBasicMath
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y);
}

<span class="rem">// Implementation of IBasicMath.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyCalc : IBasicMath
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Add(<span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> x + y;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, assume you do not have access to the code definition of IBasicMath, but wish to add a new
member (such as a subtraction method) to expand its behavior. You might attempt to author the
following extension class to do so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MathExtensions
{
    <span class="rem">// Extend IBasicMath with subtraction method?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Subtract(<span class="kwrd">this</span> IBasicMath itf,
        <span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y);
}</pre>
<p>However, this will result in compile-time errors. When you extend an interface with new members,
you must also supply an implementation of these members! This seems to fly in the face of the very
nature of interface types, as interfaces do not provide implementations, only definitions. Nevertheless,
you are required to define your MathExtensions class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MathExtensions
{
    <span class="rem">// Extend IBasicMath this method and this</span>
    <span class="rem">// implementation.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Subtract(<span class="kwrd">this</span> IBasicMath itf, <span class="kwrd">int</span> x, <span class="kwrd">int</span> y)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> x - y;
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you might assume you could create a variable of type IBasicMath and directly invoke
Subtract(). Again, if this were possible (which it is not), it would destroy the nature of .NET interface
types. In reality, what we have actually said here is “Any class in my project implementing IBasicMath
now has a Subtract() method, implemented in this manner.” As before, all the basic rules apply,
therefore the namespace defining MyCalc must have access to the namespace defining MathExtensions.
Consider the following Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Extending an interface *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Call IBasicMath members from MyCalc object.</span>
    MyCalc c = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyCalc();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"1 + 2 = {0}"</span>, c.Add(1, 2));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"1 - 2 = {0}"</span>, c.Subtract(1, 2));

    <span class="rem">// Can also cast into IBasicMath to invoke extension.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"30 - 9 = {0}"</span>, ((IBasicMath)c).Subtract(30, 9));

    <span class="rem">// This would NOT work!</span>
    <span class="rem">// IBasicMath itfBM = new IBasicMath();</span>
    <span class="rem">// itfBM.Subtract(10, 10);</span>

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>That wraps up our examination of C# extension methods. Remember that this particular language
feature can be very useful whenever you wish to extend the functionality of a type, even if you do not
have access to the original source code (or if the type is sealed), for the purposes of polymorphism. And,
much like implicitly typed local variables, extension methods are a key element of working with the
LINQ API. As you will see in the next chapter, numerous existing types in the base class libraries have
been extended with new functionality, via extension methods, to allow them to integrate with the LINQ
programming model.</p>
