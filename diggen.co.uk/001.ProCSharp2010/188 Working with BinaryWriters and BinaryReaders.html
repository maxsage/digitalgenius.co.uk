<h1>Working with BinaryWriters and BinaryReaders</h1>
<p>The final writer/reader sets you will examine in this section are BinaryReader and BinaryWriter. Both
derive directly from System.Object. These types allow you to read and write discrete data types to an
underlying stream in a compact binary format. The BinaryWriter class defines a highly overloaded
Write() method to place a data type in the underlying stream. In addition to the Write() member,
BinaryWriter provides additional members that allow you to get or set the Stream-derived type; it also
offers support for random access to the data (see Table 20-10).</p>

the BinaryWriter object.

    This method flushes the binary stream.

   <td>
    This method sets the position in the current stream.

<p>The BinaryReader class complements the functionality offered by BinaryWriter with the members
described in Table 20-11.</p>

   <td>
    This method returns the next available character without advancing the
position in the stream.

  <tr>
   <td>
    Read()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method reads a given set of bytes or characters and stores them in the
incoming array.

  <tr>
   <td>
    ReadXXXX()
   </td>
   <td>
    The BinaryReader class defines numerous read methods that grab the next type
from the stream (e.g., ReadBoolean(), ReadByte(), and ReadInt32()).

<p>The following example (a Console Application named BinaryWriterReader) writes a number of data
types to a new *.dat file:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Binary Writers / Readers *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Open a binary writer for a file.</span>
    FileInfo f = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">"BinFile.dat"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(BinaryWriter bw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BinaryWriter(f.OpenWrite()))
    {
        <span class="rem">// Print out the type of BaseStream.</span>
        <span class="rem">// (System.IO.FileStream in this case).</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Base stream is: {0}"</span>, bw.BaseStream);

        <span class="rem">// Create some data to save in the file</span>
        <span class="kwrd">double</span> aDouble = 1234.67;
        <span class="kwrd">int</span> anInt = 34567;
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> aString = <span class="str">"A, B, C"</span>;

        <span class="rem">// Write the data</span>
        bw.Write(aDouble);
        bw.Write(anInt);
        bw.Write(aString);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Notice how the FileStream object returned from FileInfo.OpenWrite() is passed to the constructor
of the BinaryWriter type. Using this technique makes it easy to layer in a stream before writing out the
data. Note that the constructor of BinaryWriter takes any Stream-derived type (e.g., FileStream,
MemoryStream, or BufferedStream). Thus, writing binary data to memory instead is as simple as supplying
a valid MemoryStream object.</p>
<p>To read the data out of the BinFile.dat file, the BinaryReader type provides a number of options.
Here, you call various read-centric members to pluck each chunk of data from the file stream:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    FileInfo f = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileInfo(<span class="str">"BinFile.dat"</span>);
...
    <span class="rem">// Read the binary data from the stream.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(BinaryReader br = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BinaryReader(f.OpenRead()))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(br.ReadDouble());
        Console.WriteLine(br.ReadInt32());
        Console.WriteLine(br.ReadString());
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
