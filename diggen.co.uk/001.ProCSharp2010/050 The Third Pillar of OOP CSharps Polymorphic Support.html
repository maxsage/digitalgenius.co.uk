    <h1>The Third Pillar of OOP: C#’s Polymorphic Support</h1>
    <p>
        Recall that the Employee base class defined a method named GiveBonus(), which was
        originally
implemented as follows:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
        currPay += amount;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p>
        Because this method has been defined with the public keyword, you can now give bonuses
        to
salespeople and managers (as well as part-time salespeople):
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** The Employee Class Hierarchy *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Give each employee a bonus?</span>
    Manager chucky = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Chucky"</span>, 50, 92, 100000, <span class="str">"333-23-2322"</span>, 9000);
    chucky.GiveBonus(300);
    chucky.DisplayStats();
    Console.WriteLine();

    SalesPerson fran = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SalesPerson(<span class="str">"Fran"</span>, 43, 93, 3000, <span class="str">"932-32-3232"</span>, 31);
    fran.GiveBonus(200);
    fran.DisplayStats();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>
        The problem with the current design is that the publicly inherited GiveBonus() method
        operates
identically for all subclasses. Ideally, the bonus of a salesperson or part-time salesperson
        should take
into account the number of sales. Perhaps managers should gain additional stock options
        in conjunction
with a monetary bump in salary. Given this, you are suddenly faced with an interesting question:
        “How
can related types respond differently to the same request?” Again, glad you asked!
    </p>
    <h2>The virtual and override Keywords</h2>
    <p>
        Polymorphism provides a way for a subclass to define its own version of a method
        defined by its base
class, using the process termed method overriding. To retrofit your current design, you
        need to
understand the meaning of the virtual and override keywords. If a base class wishes to define
        a method
that may be (but does not have to be) overridden by a subclass, it must mark the method
        with the
virtual keyword:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// This method can now be 'overridden' by a derived class.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
        currPay += amount;
    }
...
}</pre>
    <p><b>Note</b> Methods that have been marked with the virtual keyword are (not surprisingly)
        termed virtual methods.</p>
    <p>
        When a subclass wishes to change the implementation details of a virtual method,
        it does so using
the override keyword. For example, the SalesPerson and Manager could override GiveBonus()
        as follows
(assume that PTSalesPerson will not override GiveBonus() and therefore simply inherits the
        version
defined by SalesPerson):
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SalesPerson : Employee
{
...
    <span class="rem">// A salesperson's bonus is influenced by the number of sales.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">int</span> salesBonus = 0;
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (numberOfSales &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; numberOfSales &lt;= 100)
            salesBonus = 10;
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        {
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (numberOfSales &gt;= 101 &amp;&amp; numberOfSales &lt;= 200)
                salesBonus = 15;
            <span class="kwrd">else</span>
                salesBonus = 20;
        }    
        <span class="kwrd">base</span>.GiveBonus(amount * salesBonus);
    }
}
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Manager : Employee
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">base</span>.GiveBonus(amount);
        Random r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Random();
        numberOfOptions += r.Next(500);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        Notice how each overridden method is free to leverage the default behavior using
        the base keyword.
In this way, you have no need to completely reimplement the logic behind GiveBonus(), but
        can reuse
(and possibly extend) the default behavior of the parent class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also assume that the current DisplayStats() method of the Employee class has been
        declared
virtually. By doing so, each subclass can override this method to account for displaying
        the number of
sales (for salespeople) and current stock options (for managers). For example, consider
        the Manager’s
version of the DisplayStats() method (the SalesPerson class would implement DisplayStats()
        in a
similar manner to show the number of sales):
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayStats()
{
    <span class="kwrd">base</span>.DisplayStats();
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Number of Stock Options: {0}"</span>, StockOptions);
}</pre>
    <p>
        Now that each subclass can interpret what these virtual methods means to itself,
        each object
instance behaves as a more independent entity:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** The Employee Class Hierarchy *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// A better bonus system!</span>
    Manager chucky = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Chucky"</span>, 50, 92, 100000, <span class="str">"333-23-2322"</span>, 9000);
    chucky.GiveBonus(300);
    chucky.DisplayStats();
    Console.WriteLine();

    SalesPerson fran = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SalesPerson(<span class="str">"Fran"</span>, 43, 93, 3000, <span class="str">"932-32-3232"</span>, 31);
    fran.GiveBonus(200);
    fran.DisplayStats();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>The following output shows a possible test run of your application thus far:</p>

    <h2>Overriding Virtual Members Using Visual Studio 2010</h2>
    <p>"As you may have already noticed, when you are overriding a member, you must recall
        the type of each and every parameter—not to mention the method name and parameter
        passing conventions (ref, out and params). Visual Studio 2010 has a very helpful
        feature that you can make use of when overriding a virtual member. If you type the
        word “override” within the scope of a class type (then hit the spacebar), IntelliSense
        will automatically display a list of all the overridable members defined in your
        parent classes, as you see in Figure 6-6.</p>
    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_06.png" alt="Figure 6-6" />
    <p><b>Figure 6-6. </b>Quickly viewing overridable methods à la Visual Studio 2010
    </p>
    <p>
        When you select a member and hit the Enter key, the IDE responds by automatically
        filling in the
method stub on your behalf. Note that you also receive a code statement that calls your
        parent’s version
of the virtual member (you are free to delete this line if it is not required). For example,
        if you used this
technique when overriding the DisplayStats() method, you might find the following autogenerated
        code:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayStats()
{
    <span class="kwrd">base</span>.DisplayStats();
}</pre>
    <h2>Sealing Virtual Members</h2>
    <p>
        Recall that the sealed keyword can be applied to a class type to prevent other types
        from extending its
behavior via inheritance. As you may remember, you sealed PTSalesPerson as you assumed it
        made no
sense for other developers to extend this line of inheritance any further.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a related note, sometimes you may not wish to seal an entire class, but simply
        want to prevent
derived types from overriding particular virtual methods. For example, assume you do not
        want parttime
salespeople to obtain customized bonuses. To prevent the PTSalesPerson class from overriding
        the
virtual GiveBonus() method, you could effectively seal this method in the SalesPerson class
        as follows:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// SalesPerson has sealed the GiveBonus() method!</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SalesPerson : Employee
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
        ...
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        Here, SalesPerson has indeed overridden the virtual GiveBonus() method defined in
        the Employee
class; however, it has explicitly marked it as sealed. Thus, if you attempted to override
        this method in the
PTSalesPerson class you receive compile-time errors, as shown in the following code:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> PTSalesPerson : SalesPerson
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> PTSalesPerson(<span class="kwrd">string</span> fullName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID,
            <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay, <span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn, <span class="kwrd">int</span> numbOfSales)
        :<span class="kwrd">base</span> (fullName, age, empID, currPay, ssn, numbOfSales)
    {
    }

    <span class="rem">// Compiler error! Can't override this method</span>
    <span class="rem">// in the PTSalesPerson class, as it was sealed.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GiveBonus(<span class="kwrd">float</span> amount)
    {
    }
}</pre>
    <h2>Understanding Abstract Classes</h2>
    <p>
        Currently, the Employee base class has been designed to supply various data members
        for its
descendents, as well as supply two virtual methods (GiveBonus() and DisplayStats()) that
        may be
overridden by a given descendent. While this is all well and good, there is a rather odd
        byproduct of the
current design; you can directly create instances of the Employee base class:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// What exactly does this mean?</span>
Employee X = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();</pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the only real purpose of the Employee base class is to define common
        members for
all subclasses. In all likelihood, you did not intend anyone to create a direct instance
        of this class, reason
being that the Employee type itself is too general of a concept. For example, if I were
        to walk up to you
and say, “I’m an employee!” I would bet your very first question to me would be, “What kind
        of
employee are you?” Are you a consultant, trainer, admin assistant, copyeditor, or White
        House aide?
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that many base classes tend to be rather nebulous entities, a far better design
        for this example
is to prevent the ability to directly create a new Employee object in code. In C#, you can
        enforce this
programmatically by using the abstract keyword in the class definition, thus creating an
        abstract base
class:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Update the Employee class as abstract</span>
<span class="rem">// to prevent direct instantiation.</span>
<span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    ...
}</pre>
    <p>
        With this, if you now attempt to create an instance of the Employee class, you are
        issued a compiletime
error:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! Cannot create an instance of an abstract class!</span>
Employee X = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();</pre>
    <p>
        At first glance it might seem very strange to define a class that you cannot directly
        create. Recall
however that base classes (abstract or not) are very useful, in that they contain all of
        the common data
and functionality of derived types. Using this form of abstraction, we are able to model
        that the “idea” of
an employee is completely valid; it is just not a concrete entity. Also understand that
        although we cannot
directly create an abstract class, it is still assembled in memory when derived classes
        are created. Thus,
it is perfectly fine (and common) for abstract classes to define any number of constructors
        that are called
indirectly when derived classes are allocated.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, you have constructed a fairly interesting employee hierarchy. You
        will add a bit 
 more functionality to this application later in this chapter when examining C# casting
        rules. Until then, 
 Figure 6-7 illustrates the core design of your current types.
    </p>
    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_07.png" alt="Figure 6-7" />
    <h2>Understanding the Polymorphic Interface</h2>
    <p>
        When a class has been defined as an abstract base class (via the abstract keyword),
        it may define any
number of abstract members. Abstract members can be used whenever you wish to define a member
        that does not supply a default implementation, but must be accounted for by each
        derived class. By
doing so, you enforce a polymorphic interface on each descendent, leaving them to contend
        with the
task of providing the details behind your abstract methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Simply put, an abstract base class’s polymorphic interface simply refers to its
        set of virtual and
abstract methods. This is much more interesting than first meets the eye, as this trait
        of OOP allows you
to build easily extendable and flexible software applications. To illustrate, you will be
        implementing (and
slightly modifying) the hierarchy of shapes briefly examined in Chapter 5 during the overview
        of the
pillars of OOP. To begin, create a new C# Console Application project named Shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Figure 6-8, notice that the Hexagon and Circle types each extend the Shape base
        class. Like any
base class, Shape defines a number of members (a PetName property and Draw() method in this
        case) that
are common to all descendents.
    </p>
    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_08.png" alt="Figure 6-8" />
    <p><b>Figure6-8. </b>The shapes hieararchy</p>
    <p>
        Much like the employee hierarchy, you should be able to tell that you don’t want
        to allow the object
user to create an instance of Shape directly, as it is too abstract of a concept. Again,
        to prevent the direct
creation of the Shape type, you could define it as an abstract class. As well, given that
        you wish the
derived types to respond uniquely to the Draw() method, let’s mark it as virtual and define
        a default
implementation:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The abstract base class of the hierarchy.</span>
<span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Shape
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Shape(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name = <span class="str">"NoName"</span>)
    { PetName = name; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="rem">// A single virtual method.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Inside Shape.Draw()"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        Notice that the virtual Draw() method provides a default implementation that simply
        prints out a
message that informs you that you are calling the Draw() method within the Shape base class.
        Now recall
that when a method is marked with the virtual keyword, the method provides a default implementation
        that all derived types automatically inherit. If a child class so chooses, it may
        override the method but
does not have to. Given this, consider the following implementation of the Circle and Hexagon
        types:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Circle DOES NOT override Draw().</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Circle : Shape
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Circle() {}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Circle(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name) : <span class="kwrd">base</span>(name){}
}
    
<span class="rem">// Hexagon DOES override Draw().</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Hexagon : Shape
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Hexagon() {}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Hexagon(<span class="kwrd">string</span> name) : <span class="kwrd">base</span>(name){}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing {0} the Hexagon"</span>, PetName);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        The usefulness of abstract methods becomes crystal clear when you once again remember
        that
subclasses are never required to override virtual methods (as in the case of Circle). Therefore,
        if you
create an instance of the Hexagon and Circle types, you’d find that the Hexagon understands
        how to
“draw” itself correctly or at least print out an appropriate message to the console. The
        Circle, however,
is more than a bit confused:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Polymorphism *****\n"</span>);
    
    Hexagon hex = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon(<span class="str">"Beth"</span>);
    hex.Draw();

        Circle cir = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Circle(<span class="str">"Cindy"</span>);
    <span class="rem">// Calls base class implementation!</span>
    cir.Draw();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Now consider the following output of the previous Main() method:</p>
    <pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Polymorphism *****

Drawing Beth the Hexagon
Inside Shape.Draw()</pre>
    <p>
        Clearly, this is not a very intelligent design for the current hierarchy. To force
        each child class to
override the Draw() method, you can define Draw() as an abstract method of the Shape class,
        which by
definition means you provide no default implementation whatsoever. To mark a method as abstract
        in
C#, you use the abstract keyword. Notice that abstract members do not provide any implementation
        whatsoever:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Shape
{
    <span class="rem">// Force all child classes to define how to be rendered.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">abstract</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw();
    ...
}</pre>
    <p>
        <b>Note</b> Abstract methods can only be defined in abstract classes. If you attempt
        to do otherwise, you will be
issued a compiler error.
    </p>
    <p>
        Methods marked with abstract are pure protocol. They simply define the name, return
        type (if any),
and parameter set (if required). Here, the abstract Shape class informs the derived types
        “I have a method
named Draw() that takes no arguments and returns nothing. If you derive from me, you figure
        out the
details.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Given this, you are now obligated to override the Draw() method in the Circle class.
        If you do not,
Circle is also assumed to be a noncreatable abstract type that must be adorned with the
        abstract
keyword (which is obviously not very useful in this example). Here is the code update:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// If we did not implement the abstract Draw() method, Circle would also be</span>

    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing {0} the Circle"</span>, PetName);
    }

        The short answer is that you can now make the assumption that anything deriving
        from Shape does
indeed have a unique version of the Draw() method. To illustrate the full story of polymorphism,
        consider the following code:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Polymorphism *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make an array of Shape-compatible objects.</span>
    Shape[] myShapes = {<span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon(), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Circle(), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon(<span class="str">"Mick"</span>),
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> Circle(<span class="str">"Beth"</span>), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon(<span class="str">"Linda"</span>)};

    <span class="rem">// Loop over each item and interact with the</span>
    <span class="rem">// polymorphic interface.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Shape s <span class="kwrd">in</span> myShapes)
    {
        s.Draw();
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>Here is the output from the modified Main() method:</p>
    <pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Polymorphism *****

Drawing NoName the Hexagon
Drawing NoName the Circle
Drawing Mick the Hexagon
Drawing Beth the Circle
Drawing Linda the Hexagon</pre>
    <p>
        This Main() method illustrates polymorphism at its finest. Although it is not possible
        to directly
create an instance of an abstract base class (the Shape), you are able to freely store references
        to any
subclass with an abstract base variable. Therefore, when you are creating an array of Shapes,
        the array
can hold any object deriving from the Shape base class (if you attempt to place Shape-incompatible
        objects into the array, you receive a compiler error).
    </p>
    <p>
        Given that all items in the myShapes array do indeed derive from Shape, you know
        they all support the
same "polymorphic interface" (or said more plainly, they all have a Draw() method). As you
        iterate over
the array of Shape references, it is at runtime that the underlying type is determined.
        At this point, the
correct version of the Draw() method is invoked in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        This technique also makes it very simple to safely extend the current hierarchy.
        For example,
assume you derived more classes from the abstract Shape base class (Triangle, Square, etc.).
        Due to the
polymorphic interface, the code within your foreach loop would not have to change in the
        slightest as
the compiler enforces that only Shape-compatible types are placed within the myShapes array.

    <h2>Understanding Member Shadowing</h2>
    <p>
        C# provides a facility that is the logical opposite of method overriding termed
        shadowing. Formally
speaking, if a derived class defines a member that is identical to a member defined in a
        base class, the
derived class has shadowed the parent’s version. In the real world, the possibility of this
        occurring is the
greatest when you are subclassing from a class you (or your team) did not create yourselves
        (for
example, if you purchase a third-party .NET software package).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the sake of illustration, assume you receive a class named ThreeDCircle from
        a coworker (or
classmate) that defines a subroutine named Draw() taking no arguments:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> ThreeDCircle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing a 3D Circle"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>You figure that a ThreeDCircle “is-a” Circle, so you derive from your existing Circle
        type:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> ThreeDCircle : Circle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing a 3D Circle"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Once you recompile, you find a warning in the Visual Studio 2010 error window (see
        Figure 6-9).</p>

    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_09.png" alt="Figure 6-9" />
    <p><b>Figure 6-9.</b> Oops! You just shadowed a member in your parent class</p>
    <p>
        The problem is that you have a derived class (ThreeDCircle) which contains a method
        that is
identical to an inherited method. Again, the exact warning reported by the compiler is:
    </p>
    <pre class="csharpcode">'Shapes.ThreeDCircle.Draw()' hides inherited member 'Shapes.Circle.Draw()'. To make the
current member override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new
keyword.</pre>
    <p>
        To address this issue, you have two options. You could simply update the parent’s
        version of
Draw()using the override keyword (as suggested by the compiler). With this approach, the
        ThreeDCircle
type is able to extend the parent’s default behavior as required. However, if you don’t
        have access to the
code defining the base class (again, as would be the case in many third-party libraries),
        you would be
unable to modify the Draw()method as a virtual member, as you don’t have access to the code
        file!
    </p>
    <p>
        As an alternative, you can include the new keyword to the offending Draw() member
        of the derived
type (ThreeDCircle in this example). Doing so explicitly states that the derived type’s
        implementation is
intentionally designed to effectively ignore the parent’s version (again, in the real world,
        this can be
helpful if external .NET software somehow conflicts with your current software).
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This class extends Circle and hides the inherited Draw() method.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> ThreeDCircle : Circle
{
    <span class="rem">// Hide any Draw() implementation above me.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing a 3D Circle"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        You can also apply the new keyword to any member type inherited from a base class
        (field, constant,
static member, or property). As a further example, assume that ThreeDCircle wishes to hide
        the inherited
PetName property:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> ThreeDCircle : Circle
{
    <span class="rem">// Hide the PetName property above me.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> PetName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

        <span class="rem">// Hide any Draw() implementation above me.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Drawing a 3D Circle"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        Finally, be aware that it is still possible to trigger the base class implementation
        of a shadowed
member using an explicit cast, as described in the next section. For example, the following
        code shows:
    </p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// This calls the Draw() method of the ThreeDCircle.</span>
    ThreeDCircle o = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ThreeDCircle();
    o.Draw();

    <span class="rem">// This calls the Draw() method of the parent!</span>
    ((Circle)o).Draw();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
