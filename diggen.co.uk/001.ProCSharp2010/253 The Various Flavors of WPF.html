<h1>The Various Flavors of WPF</h1>
<p>The WPF API can be used to build a variety of GUI-centric applications that basically differ in their
navigational structure and deployment models. The sections that follow present a high-level walk
through each option.</p>
<h2>Traditional Desktop Applications</h2>
<p>The first (and most familiar) option is to use WPF to build a traditional executable assembly that runs on
a local machine. For example, you could use WPF to build a text editor, painting program, or multimedia
program such as a digital music player, photo viewer, and so forth. Like any other desktop applications,
these *.exe files can be installed using traditional means (setup programs, Windows Installer packages,
etc.) or via ClickOnce technology to allow desktop applications to be distributed and installed via a
remote web server.</p>
<p>Programmatically speaking, this type of WPF application will make use (at a minimum) of the
Window and Application types, in addition to the expected set of dialog boxes, toolbars, status bars, menu
systems, and other UI elements.</p>
<p>Now, you can certainly use WPF to build your basic, bland business application that does not
support any bells and whistles, but WPF really shines when you do incorporate such features. Consider
Figure 27-1, which shows a WPF sample desktop application for viewing patient records in a medical
environment.</p>

<p><b>Figure 27-1</b> This WPF desktop application makes use of several WPF APIs</p>
<p>Sadly, the printed page does not show the full feature set of this window. Note that the upper right
of the main window is displaying a real time graph of the patient's sinus rhythm. If you click on Patient
Details button on the lower right, several animations take place to flip, rotate and transform the UI to the
following look and feel (Figure 27-2).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure27_02.png" alt="Figure 27-2" />
<p><b>Figure 27-2</b> Transformations and animations are very simple under WPF</p>
<p>Could you build this same application without WPF? Absolutely. However, the amount of code—
and the complexity of the code—would be much higher.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>This example application can be downloaded (with source code) from the office WPF web site,
http://windowsclient.net. Here you will find numerous WPF (and Windows Forms) sample projects, technology
walkthroughs and forums.</p>
<h2>Navigation-Based WPF Applications</h2>
<p>WPF applications can optionally choose to make use of a navigation-based structure, which makes a
traditional desktop application take on the basic behavior of a web browser application. Using this
model, you can build a desktop *.exe that provides a “forward” and “back” button that allows the end
user to move back and forth between various UI displays called pages.</p>
<p>The application itself maintains a list of each page and provides the necessary infrastructure to
navigate between them, pass data across pages (similar to a web-based application variable), and
maintain a history list. By way of a concrete example, consider Windows Explorer (see Figure 27-3),
which makes use of such functionality. Notice the navigation buttons (and history list) mounted on the
upper-left corner of the window.</p>

<p><b>Figure 27-3</b> A navigation-based desktop program</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that a WPF desktop application can take on a weblike navigational structure,
understand that this is simply a UI design issue. The application itself is still little more than a local
executable assembly running on a desktop machine, and it has little to do with a web application
beyond a slightly similar look and feel. Programmatically speaking, this type of WPF application is
constructed using classes such as Application, Page, NavigationWindow, and Frame.</p>
<h2>XBAP Applications</h2>
<p>WPF also allows you to build applications that can be hosted within a web browser. This flavor of WPF
application is termed an XAML browser application, or XBAP. Under this model, the end user navigates
to a given URL, at which point the XBAP (which is essentially a collection of Page objects) is transparently
downloaded and installed to the local machine. Unlike a traditional ClickOnce installation for an
executable application, however, the XBAP program is hosted directly within the browser and adopts the
browser’s intrinsic navigational system. Figure 27-4 illustrates an XBAP program in action (specifically,
the ExpenseIt WPF sample program that ships with the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure27_04.png" alt="Figure 27-4" />
<p><b>Figure 27-4</b> XBAP programs are downloaded to a local machine and hosted within a web browser</p>
<p>The benefit of an XBAP is that it allows you to create sophisticated UIs which are much more
expressive than a typical web page built with HTML and JavaScript. An XBAP Page object can make use
of the same WPF services as a desktop WPF application, including animations, 2D and 3D graphics,
themes and whatnot. In effect, the web browser is just a container for WPF Page objects, and is not
displaying ASP.NET web pages.</p>
<p>However, given that these Page objects are deployed to a remote web server, XBAPs can be easily
versioned and updated without the need to redeploy executables to the user's desktop. Like a traditional
web program, you can simply update the Page objects in the web server, and the user will get the 'latest
and greatest' when they access the URL.</p>
<p>One downside to this flavor of WPF is that XBAPs must be hosted within Microsoft Internet Explorer
or Firefox web browsers. If you are deploying XBAPs across a company intranet, browser compatibility
should not be a problem, given that system administrators can play dictator regarding which browser
should be installed on users’ machines. However, if you want the outside world to make use of your
XBAP, it is not possible to ensure each end user is making use of Internet Explorer/Firefox, and therefore
some external users may not be able to view your WPF XBAP.</p>
<p>Another issue to be aware of is the machine which is viewing an XBAP must have a local installation
of the .NET framework, as the Page objects will be using the same .NET assemblies as an application
running natively on the machine. Given this particular point, XBAPs are limited to Windows operating
systems and thus cannot be viewed on a system running Mac OS X or Linux.</p>
<h2>The WPF/Silverlight Relationship</h2>
<p>WPF and XAML also provide the foundation for a cross-platform, cross-browser WPF-based technology
termed Silverlight. From a high level, you can consider Silverlight as a competitor to Adobe Flash, with
the benefit of using C# and XAML rather than a new set of tools and languages. Silverlight is a subset of
WPF functionality, which is used to build highly interactive plug-ins for a larger HTML-based web page.
In reality, however, Silverlight is a completely unique distribution of the .NET platform, which ships with
a "mini" CLR and "mini" version of the .NET base class libraries.</p>
<p>Unlike an XBAP, the user's machine does not need a full installation of the .NET Framework. As long
as the target machine has the Silverlight runtime installed, the browser will load the Silverlight runtime
and display the Silverlight application automatically. Best of all, Silverlight plug-ins are not limited to the
Windows operating systems! Microsoft has also created a Silverlight runtime for Mac OS X.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The Mono project (see Appendix B) provides an open source version of Silverlight for Linux based OSs
named Moonlight. This API, in conjunction with Silverlight, provides the fabric for a true cross-platform model for
extremely rich web pages.</p>
<p>With Silverlight, you are able to build extremely feature-rich (and interactive) web applications. For
example, like WPF, Silverlight has a vector-based graphical system, animation support, and multimedia
support. Furthermore, you are able to incorporate a subset of the .NET base class library into your
applications. This subset includes a number of WPF controls, LINQ support, generic collection types,
web service support, and a healthy subset of mscorlib.dll (file I/O, XML manipulation, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> This edition of the text does not address Silverlight; however, a majority of your WPF knowledge will map
directly to the construction of Silverlight web plug-ins. If you are interested in learning more about this API, check
