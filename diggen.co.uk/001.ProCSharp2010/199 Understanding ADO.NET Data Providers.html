<h1>Understanding ADO.NET Data Providers</h1>
<p>Unlike other database APIs you might have used in the past, ADO.NET does not provide a single set of
types that communicate with multiple database management systems (DBMSs). Rather, ADO.NET
supports multiple data providers, each of which is optimized to interact with a specific DBMS. The first
benefit of this approach is that you can program a specific data provider to access any unique features of
a particular DBMS. The second benefit is that a specific data provider can connect directly to the
underlying engine of the DBMS in question without an intermediate mapping layer standing between
the tiers.</p> 
<p>Simply put, a data provider is a set of types defined in a given namespace that understand how to
communicate with a specific type of data source. Regardless of which data provider you use, each
defines a set of class types that provide core functionality. Table 21-1 documents some of the core
common types, their base class (all defined in the System.Data.Common namespace), and the key
interfaces (each is defined in the System.Data namespace) they implement.</p>

<p>Although the specific names of these core classes will differ among data providers (e.g.,
SqlConnection vs. OracleConnection vs. OdbcConnection vs. MySqlConnection), each class derives from the
same base class (DbConnection, in the case of connection objects) that implements identical interfaces
(e.g., IDbConnection). Given this, you would be correct to assume that once you learn how to work with
one data provider, the remaining providers prove quite straightforward.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> When you refer to a connection object under ADO.NET, you’re actually referring to a specific
DbConnection-derived type; there is no class literally named Connection. The same idea holds true for a
command object, data adapter object, and so forth. As a naming convention, the objects in a specific data provider
are prefixed with the name of the related DBMS (e.g., SqlConnection, OracleConnection, and
SqlDataReader).</p>
<p>Figure 21-2 shows the big picture behind ADO.NET data providers. Note how the diagram illustrates
that the Client Assembly can literally be any type of .NET application: console program, Windows Forms
application, WPF application, ASP.NET web page, WCF service, a .NET code library, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Figure 21-2</b> ADO.NET data providers provide access to a given DBMS</p>
<p>A data provider will supply you with other types beyond the objects shown in Figure 21-2; however,
these core objects define a common baseline across all data providers.</p>
<h2>The Microsoft-Supplied ADO.NET Data Providers</h2>
<p>Microsoft’s .NET distribution ships with numerous data providers, including a provider for Oracle, SQL
Server, and OLE DB/ODBC-style connectivity. Table 21-2 documents the namespace and containing
assembly for each Microsoft ADO.NET data provider.</p>

   </td>
  </tr>
 </TableRowGroup>
</table>
<p><b>Note</b> There is no specific data provider that maps directly to the Jet engine (and therefore Microsoft Access). If
you wish to interact with an Access data file, you can do so using the OLE DB or ODBC data provider.</p>
<p>The OLE DB data provider, which is composed of the types defined in the System.Data.OleDb
namespace, allows you to access data located in any data store that supports the classic COM-based OLE
DB protocol. You can use this provider to communicate with any OLE DB–compliant database simply by
tweaking the Provider segment of your connection string.</p>
<p>However, the OLE DB provider interacts with various COM objects behind the scenes, which can
affect the performance of your application. By and large, the OLE DB data provider is only useful if you
interact with a DBMS that does not define a specific .NET data provider. However, given the fact that
these days any DBMS worth its salt should have a custom ADO.NET data provider for download, you
should consider System.Data.OleDb a legacy namespace that has little use in the .NET 4.0 world (this is
even more the case with the advent of the data provider factory model introduced under .NET 2.0, which
you will learn about shortly).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> There is one case in which using the types of System.Data.OleDb is necessary: when you need to
communicate with Microsoft SQL Server version 6.5 or earlier. The System.Data.SqlClient namespace can
only communicate with Microsoft SQL Server version 7.0 or higher.</p>
<p>The Microsoft SQL Server data provider offers direct access to Microsoft SQL Server data stores—
and only SQL Server data stores (version 7.0 and greater). The System.Data.SqlClient namespace
contains the types used by the SQL Server provider and offers the same basic functionality as the OLE
DB provider. The key difference is that the SQL Server provider bypasses the OLE DB layer and gives
numerous performance benefits. The Microsoft SQL Server data provider also allows you to gain access
to the unique features of this particular DBMS.</p>
<p>The remaining Microsoft-supplied providers (System.Data.Odbc and System.Data.SqlClientCe)
provide access to ODBC connections, and the SQL Server Mobile edition DBMS (commonly used by
handheld devices, such as Windows Mobile). The ODBC types defined within the System.Data.Odbc
namespace are typically only useful if you need to communicate with a given DBMS for which there is
no custom .NET data provider. This is true because ODBC is a widespread model that provides access to
a number of data stores.</p>
<h2>A Word Regarding System.Data.OracleClient.dll</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of the .NET platform shipped with an assembly named System.Data.OracleClient.dll,
which as the name suggests, offered a data provider to communicate with Oracle databases. As of .NET
4.0, however, this assembly has been marked as obsolete and will eventually be deprecated.</p>
<p>At first glance, this might cause you to fear that ADO.NET is slowly becoming focused squarely on
Microsoft-centric data stores; however, this is not the case. Oracle provides its own custom .NET
assembly, which follows the same overall design guidelines as the data providers provided by Microsoft.
If you need to obtain this .NET assembly, you can visit the downloads section of Oracle’s web site at
www.oracle.com/technology/tech/windows/odpnet/index.html.</p>
<h2>Obtaining Third-Party ADO.NET Data Providers</h2>
<p>In addition to the data providers that ship from Microsoft (as well as Oracle’s custom .NET library),
numerous third-party data providers exist for various open source and commercial databases. While you
will most likely be able to obtain an ADO.NET data provider directly from the database vendor, you
should be aware of the following site: www.sqlsummit.com/DataProv.htm.</p>
<p>This web site is one of many sites that document each known ADO.NET data provider and provide
links for more information and downloads. Here you will find numerous ADO.NET providers, including
SQLite, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, TurboDB, Sybase, and many others.</p>
<p>Given the large number of ADO.NET data providers, the examples in this book will use the Microsoft
SQL Server data provider (System.Data.SqlClient.dll). Recall that this provider allows you to
communicate with Microsoft SQL Server version 7.0 and higher, including SQL Server Express Edition. If
you intend to use ADO.NET to interact with another DBMS, you should have no problem doing so once
you understand the material presented in the pages that follow.</p>
