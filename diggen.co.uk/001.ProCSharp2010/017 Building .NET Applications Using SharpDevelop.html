    <h1>Building .NET Applications Using SharpDevelop</h1>
    <p>As you may agree, authoring C# code with Notepad++ is a step in the right direction, compared to
    Notepad and the command prompt. However, these tools do not provide rich IntelliSense capabilities
    for C# code, designers for building graphical user interfaces, project templates, or database
    manipulation tools. To address such needs, allow me to introduce the next .NET development option:
    SharpDevelop (also known as #Develop).</p>
    <p>SharpDevelop is an open source and feature-rich IDE that you can utilize to build .NET assemblies
    using C#, VB, CIL, or a Python-inspired .NET language named Boo. Beyond the fact that this IDE is
    completely free, it is interesting to note that it was written entirely in C#. In fact, you have the choice to
    download and compile the *.cs files manually or run a setup.exe program to install SharpDevelop on
    your development machine. Both distributions can be obtained from http://www.sharpdevelop.com.</p>
    <p>SharpDevelop provides numerous productivity enhancements. Here is a hit list of some of the major
    benefits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Support for multiple .NET languages and project types</li>
        <li>IntelliSense, code completion, and code snippet capabilities</li>
        <li>An Add Reference dialog box to reference external assemblies, including assemblies deployed to
        the global assembly cache (GAC)</li>
        <li>A visual Windows Forms designer</li>
        <li>Integrated object browsing and code definition utilities</li>
        <li>Visual database designer utilities</li>
        <li>A C#-to-VB (and vice versa) code-conversion utility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Impressive for a free IDE, is it not? Although this chapter doesn't cover each of these points in detail,
    let's walk through a few items of interest.</p>
    <p><b>Note </b>At the time of this writing, the current version of SharpDevelop does not support C# 2010 / .NET 4.0
    features. Be sure to check the SharpDevelop web site for future releases.</p>
    <h2>Building a Simple Test Project</h2>
    <p>Once you have installed SharpDevelop, the File ? New ? Solution menu option allows you to pick
    which type of project you wish to generate (and in which .NET language). For example, assume you have
    created a C# Windows Application solution named MySDWinApp (see Figure 2-5).</p>

    <p><b>Figure 2-5.</b> The SharpDevelop New Project dialog box</p>
    <p>Like Visual Studio, you have a Windows Forms GUI designer toolbox (to drag and drop controls
    onto the designer), and a Properties window to set up the look and feel of each UI item. Figure 2-6
    illustrates configuring a button control using the IDE (note that I clicked on the Design tab mounted on
    the bottom of the opened code file).</p>

    <p><b>Figure 2-6. </b>Graphically designing a Windows Forms Application with SharpDevelop</p>
    <p>If you were to click the Source button mounted to the bottom of the form's designer, you would find
    the expected IntelliSense, code completion, and integrated help features (see Figure 2-7).</p>

    <p><b>Figure 2-7.</b> SharpDevelop supports numerous code-generation utilities</p>
    <p>SharpDevelop was designed to mimic much of the same functionality found within Microsoft's
    .NET IDEs (which we will examine next). Given this point, I won't dive into all of the features of this open
    source .NET IDE. If you require more information, simply use the provided Help menu.</p>
