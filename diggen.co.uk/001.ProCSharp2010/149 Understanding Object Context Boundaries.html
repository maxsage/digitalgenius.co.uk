<h1>Understanding Object Context Boundaries</h1>
    <p>As you have just seen, AppDomains are logical partitions within a process used to host .NET assemblies.
On a related note, a given application domain may be further subdivided into numerous context
boundaries. In a nutshell, a .NET context provides a way for a single AppDomain to establish a “specific
home” for a given object.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Friendly FYI, while understanding processes and application domains is quite important, most .NET applications
will never demand that you work with object contexts. I've included this material just to paint a more complete picture.</p>
<p>Using context, the CLR is able to ensure that objects that have special runtime requirements are
handled in an appropriate and consistent manner by intercepting method invocations into and out of a
given context. This layer of interception allows the CLR to adjust the current method invocation to
conform to the contextual settings of a given object. For example, if you define a C# class type that
requires automatic thread safety (using the [Synchronization] attribute), the CLR will create a
“synchronized context” during allocation.</p>
<p>Just as a process defines a default AppDomain, every application domain has a default context. This
default context (sometimes referred to as context 0, given that it is always the first context created within
an application domain) is used to group together .NET objects that have no specific or unique
contextual needs. As you may expect, a vast majority of .NET objects are loaded into context 0. If the CLR
determines a newly created object has special needs, a new context boundary is created within the
hosting application domain. Figure 16-3 illustrates the process/AppDomain/context relationship.</p>

<h2>Context-Agile and Context-Bound Types</h2>
<p>.NET objects that do not demand any special contextual treatment are termed context-agile objects.
These objects can be accessed from anywhere within the hosting AppDomain without interfering with
the object’s runtime requirements. Building context-agile objects is very easy, given that you simply do
nothing (specifically, you do not adorn the type with any contextual attributes and do not derive from
the System.ContextBoundObject base class):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A context-agile object is loaded into context zero.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SportsCar{}</pre>
<p>On the other hand, objects that do demand contextual allocation are termed context-bound objects,
and they must derive from the System.ContextBoundObject base class. This base class solidifies the fact
that the object in question can function appropriately only within the context in which it was created.
Given the role of .NET context, it should stand to reason that if a context-bound object were to somehow
end up in an incompatible context, bad things would be guaranteed to occur at the most inopportune
times.</p>
<p>In addition to deriving from System.ContextBoundObject, a context-sensitive type will also be
adorned by a special category of .NET attributes termed (not surprisingly) context attributes. All context
attributes derive from the ContextAttribute base class. Let’s see an example.</p>
<h2>Defining a Context-Bound Object</h2>
<p>Assume that you wish to define a class (SportsCarTS) that is automatically thread safe in nature, even
though you have not hard-coded thread synchronization logic within the member implementations. To
do so, derive from ContextBoundObject and apply the [Synchronization] attribute as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Runtime.Remoting.Contexts;

<span class="rem">// This context-bound type will only be loaded into a</span>
<span class="rem">// synchronized (hence thread-safe) context.</span>
[Synchronization]
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SportsCarTS : ContextBoundObject
{}</pre>
<p>Types that are attributed with the [Synchronization] attribute are loaded into a thread-safe context.
Given the special contextual needs of the SportsCarTS class type, imagine the problems that would occur
if an allocated object were moved from a synchronized context into a nonsynchronized context. The
object is suddenly no longer thread safe and thus becomes a candidate for massive data corruption, as
numerous threads are attempting to interact with the (now thread-volatile) reference object. To ensure
the CLR does not move SportsCarTS objects outside of a synchronized context, simply derive from
ContextBoundObject.</p>
<h2>Inspecting an Object’s Context</h2>
<p>Although very few of the applications you will write will need to programmatically interact with context,
here is an illustrative example. Create a new Console Application named ObjectContextApp. This
application defines one context-agile class (SportsCar) and a single context-bound type (SportsCarTS):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Runtime.Remoting.Contexts; <span class="rem">// For Context type.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Threading; <span class="rem">// For Thread type.</span>

<span class="rem">// SportsCar has no special contextual</span>
<span class="rem">// needs and will be loaded into the</span>
<span class="rem">// default context of the app domain.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SportsCar
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SportsCar()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get context information and print out context ID.</span>
        Context ctx = Thread.CurrentContext;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} object in context {1}"</span>,
            <span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString(), ctx.ContextID);
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(IContextProperty itfCtxProp <span class="kwrd">in</span> ctx.ContextProperties)
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Ctx Prop: {0}"</span>, itfCtxProp.Name);
    }
}

<span class="rem">// SportsCarTS demands to be loaded in</span>
<span class="rem">// a synchronization context.</span>
[Synchronization]
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SportsCarTS : ContextBoundObject
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> SportsCarTS()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get context information and print out context ID.</span>
        Context ctx = Thread.CurrentContext;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} object in context {1}"</span>,
            <span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString(), ctx.ContextID);
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(IContextProperty itfCtxProp <span class="kwrd">in</span> ctx.ContextProperties)
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Ctx Prop: {0}"</span>, itfCtxProp.Name);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that each constructor obtains a Context object from the current thread of execution, via the
static Thread.CurrentContext property. Using the Context object, you are able to print out statistics
about the contextual boundary, such as its assigned ID, as well as a set of descriptors obtained via
Context.ContextProperties. This property returns an array of objects implementing the
IContextProperty interface, which exposes each descriptor through the Name property. Now, update
Main() to allocate an instance of each class type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Object Context *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Objects will display contextual info upon creation.</span>
    SportsCar sport = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar();
    Console.WriteLine();

    SportsCar sport2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar();
    Console.WriteLine();

    SportsCarTS synchroSport = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCarTS();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>As the objects come to life, the class constructors will dump out various bits of context-centric
information (the "lease life time service property" printout is a low level aspect of the .NET remoting
layer, and can be ignored):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Object Context *****

ObjectContextApp.SportsCar object in context 0
-> Ctx Prop: LeaseLifeTimeServiceProperty

ObjectContextApp.SportsCar object in context 0
-> Ctx Prop: LeaseLifeTimeServiceProperty

ObjectContextApp.SportsCarTS object in context 1
-> Ctx Prop: LeaseLifeTimeServiceProperty
-> Ctx Prop: Synchronization
</pre>
<p>Given that the SportsCar class has not been qualified with a context attribute, the CLR has allocated
sport and sport2 into context 0 (i.e., the default context). However, the SportsCarTS object is loaded into
a unique contextual boundary (which has been assigned a context ID of 1), given the fact that this
context-bound type was adorned with the [Synchronization] attribute.</p>
