<h1>The Motivation Behind WPF</h1>
    <p>Over the years, Microsoft has created numerous graphical user interface toolkits (raw C/C++/Windows
API development, VB6, MFC, etc.) to build desktop executables. Each of these APIs provided a code base
to represent the basic aspects of a GUI application, including main windows, dialog boxes, controls,
menu systems, and other basic necessities. With the initial release of the .NET platform, the Windows Forms
API quickly became the preferred model for UI development, given its simple yet very powerful object
model.</p>
<p>While many full-featured desktop applications have been successfully created using Windows
Forms, the fact of the matter is that this programming model is rather asymmetrical. Simply put,
System.Windows.Forms.dll and System.Drawing.dll do not provide direct support for many additional
technologies required to build a feature-rich desktop application. To illustrate this point, consider the ad
hoc nature of GUI development before the release of WPF (e.g., .NET 2.0; see Table 27-1).</p>

<p>As you can see, a Windows Forms developer must pull in types from a number of unrelated APIs and
object models. While it is true that making use of these diverse APIs may look similar syntactically (it is
just C# code, after all), you may also agree that each technology requires a radically different mind-set.
For example, the skills required to create a 3D rendered animation using DirectX are completely
different from those used to bind data to a grid. To be sure, it is very difficult for a Windows Forms
programmer to master the diverse nature of each API.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Appendix A provides an introduction to Windows Forms and GDI+ application development.</p>
<h2>Unifying Diverse APIs</h2>
<p>WPF (introduced with .NET 3.0) was purposely created to merge these previously unrelated
programming tasks into a single unified object model. Thus, if you need to author a 3D animation, you
have no need to manually program against the DirectX API (although you could), as 3D functionality is
baked directly into WPF. To see how well things have cleaned up, consider Table 27-2, which illustrates
the desktop development model ushered in as of .NET 3.0.</p>

<p>The obvious benefit here is that .NET programmers now have a single, symmetrical API for all
common GUI programming needs. Once you become comfortable with the functionality of the key WPF
assemblies and the grammar of XAML, you'll be amazed how quickly you can create very sophisticated
UIs.</p>
<h2>Providing a Separation of Concerns via XAML</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most compelling benefits is that WPF provides a way to cleanly separate the look and
feel of a Windows application from the programming logic that drives it. Using XAML, it is possible to
define the UI of an application via XML markup. This markup (ideally generated using tools such as
Microsoft Expression Blend) can then be connected to a managed code base to provide the guts of the
program’s functionality.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> XAML is not limited to WPF applications! Any application can use XAML to describe a tree of .NET objects,
even if they have nothing to do with a visible user interface. For example, the Windows Workflow Foundation API
uses a XAML-based grammar to define business processes and custom activities.</p>
<p>As you dig into WPF, you may be surprised how much flexibility “desktop markup” provides. XAML
allows you to define not only simple UI elements (buttons, grids, list boxes, etc.) in markup, but also 2D
and 3D graphical data, animations, data binding logic, and multimedia functionality (such as video
playback). For example, defining a circular button control that animates a company logo requires just a
few lines of markup.</p>
<p>As shown in Chapter 31, WPF controls can be modified through styles and templates, which allow
you to change the overall look and feel of an application with minimum fuss and bother. Unlike
Windows Forms development, the only compelling reason to build a custom WPF control library is if
you need to change the behaviors of a control (e.g., add custom methods, properties, or events; subclass
an existing control to override virtual members). If you simply need to change the look and feel of a
control (again, such as a circular animated button), you can do so entirely through markup.</p>
<h2>Providing an Optimized Rendering Model</h2>
<p>GUI toolkits such as Windows Forms, MFC or VB6 preformed all graphical rendering requests (including
the rendering of UI elements such as buttons and list boxes) using a low level, C-based API (GDI) which
has been part of the Windows OS for years. GDI provides adequate performance for typical business
applications or simple graphical programs; however, if a UI application needed to tap into high
performance graphics, DirectX was required.</p>
<p>The WPF programming model is quite different in that GDI is not used when rendering graphical
data. All rendering operations (e.g., 2D graphics, 3D graphics, animations, UI widget renderings buttons,
list boxes) now make use of the DirectX API. The first obvious benefit is that your WPF applications will
automatically take advantage of hardware and software optimizations. As well, WPF applications can tap
into very rich graphical services (blur effects, anti-aliasing, transparency, etc.) without the complexity of
programming directly against the DirectX API.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Although WPF does push all rendering requests to the DirectX layer, I don't want to suggest that a WPF
application will perform as fast as building an application using unmanaged C++ and DirectX directly. If you are
build a desktop application that requires the fastest possible execution speed (such as a 3D video game),
unmanaged C++ and DirectX are still the best approach.</p>
<h2>Simplifying Complex UI Programming</h2>
<p>To recap the story thus far, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is an API to build desktop
applications that integrates various desktop APIs into a single object model and provides a clean
separation of concerns via XAML. In addition to these major points, WPF applications also benefit from
a very simple way to integrate services into your programs, which historically were quite complex to
account for. Here is a quick rundown of the core WPF features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A number of layout managers (far more than Windows Forms) to provide
extremely flexible control over placement and reposition of content.</li>
 <li>Use of an enhanced data-binding engine to bind content to UI elements in a
variety of ways.</li>
 <li>A built-in style engine, which allows you to define “themes” for a WPF application.</li>
 <li>Use of vector graphics, which allows content to be automatically resized to fit the
size and resolution of the screen hosting the application.</li>
 <li>Support for 2D and 3D graphics, animations, and video and audio playback.</li>
 <li>A rich typography API, such as support for XML Paper Specification (XPS)
documents, fixed documents (WYSIWYG), flow documents, and document
annotations (e.g., a Sticky Notes API).</li>
  <li>Support for interoperating with legacy GUI models (e.g., Windows Forms, ActiveX,
and Win32 HWNDs). For example, you can incorporate custom Windows Forms
controls into a WPF application, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have some idea of what WPF brings to the table, let's turn our attention to the various
types of applications that can be created using this API.</p>
