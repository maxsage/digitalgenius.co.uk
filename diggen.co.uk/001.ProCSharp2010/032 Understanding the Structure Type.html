    <h1>
        Understanding the Structure Type</h1>
        <p>
            Now that you understand the role of enumeration types, let's examine the use of
            .NET structures (or simply structs). Structure types are well suited for modeling
            mathematical, geometrical, and other "atomic" entities in your application. A structure
            (like an enumeration) is a user-defined type; however, structures are not simply
            a collection of name/value pairs. Rather, structures are types that can contain
            any number of data fields and members that operate on these fields.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Note</b> If you have a background in OOP, you can think of a structure as a "lightweight
            class type," given that structures provide a way to define a type that supports
            encapsulation, but cannot be used to build a family of related types. When you need
            to build a family of related types through inheritance, you will need to make use
            of class types.</p>
        <p>
            On the surface, the process of defining and using structures is very simple, but
            as they say, the devil is in the details. To begin understanding the basics of structure
            types, create a new project named FunWithStructures. In C#, structures are created
            using the struct keyword. Define a new structure named Point, which defines two
            member variables of type int and a set of methods to interact with said data:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">struct</span> Point
{
    <span class="rem">// Fields of the structure.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> X;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Y;

    <span class="rem">// Add 1 to the (X, Y) position.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Increment()
    {
        X++; Y++;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Subtract 1 from the (X, Y) position.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Decrement()
    {
        X--; Y--;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Display the current position.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"X = {0}, Y = {1}"</span>, X, Y);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Here, you have defined your two integer fields (X and Y) using the public keyword, which is an
    access control modifier. Declaring data with the public keyword
    ensures the caller has direct access to the data from a given Point variable (via the dot operator).</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> It is typically considered bad style to define public data within a class or structure. Rather, you will want to
    define private data, which can be accessed and changed using public properties.</p>
    <p>Here is a Main() method that takes our Point type out for a test drive:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** A First Look at Structures *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="rem">// Create an initial Point.</span>
    Point myPoint;
    myPoint.X = 349;
    myPoint.Y = 76;
    myPoint.Display();

    <span class="rem">// Adjust the X and Y values.</span>
    myPoint.Increment();
    myPoint.Display();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>The output is as you would expect:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** A First Look at Structures *****

X = 349, Y = 76
X = 350, Y = 77</pre>
    <h2>Creating Structure Variables</h2>
     <p>When you wish to create a structure variable, you have a variety of options. Here, you simply create a
    Point variable and assign each piece of public field data before invoking its members. If you do not
    assign each piece of public field data (X and Y in our case) before making use of the structure, you will
    receive a compiler error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! Did not assign Y value.</span>
Point p1;
p1.X = 10;
p1.Display();

<span class="rem">// OK! Both fields assigned before use.</span>
Point p2;
p2.X = 10;
p2.Y = 10;
p2.Display();</pre>
    <p>As an alternative, we can create structure variables using the C# new keyword, which will invoke the
    structure's default constructor. By definition, a default constructor does not take any arguments. The
    benefit of invoking the default constructor of a structure is that each piece of field data is automatically
    set to its default value:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Set all fields to default values</span>
<span class="rem">// using the default constructor.</span>
Point p1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point();

<span class="rem">// Prints X=0,Y=0</span>
p1.Display();</pre>
    <p>It is also possible to design a structure with a custom constructor. This allows you to specify the
    values of field data upon variable creation, rather than having to set each data member field by field.
    To illustrate, update the Point structure with the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">struct</span> Point
{
    <span class="rem">// Fields of the structure.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> X;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Y;

    <span class="rem">// A custom constructor.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Point(<span class="kwrd">int</span> XPos, <span class="kwrd">int</span> YPos)
    {
        X = XPos;
        Y = YPos;
    }
...
}
</pre>
    <p>With this, we could now create Point variables as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Call custom constructor.</span>
Point p2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(50, 60);

<span class="rem">// Prints X=50,Y=60</span>
p2.Display();

</pre>
    <p>As mentioned, working with structures on the surface is quite simple. However, to deepen your
    understanding of this type, you need to explore the distinction between a .NET value type and a .NET
    reference type.</p>
