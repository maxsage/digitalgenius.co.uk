<h1>Building Disposable Objects</h1>
   <p>As you have seen, finalizers can be used to release unmanaged resources when the garbage collector
kicks in. However, given that many unmanaged objects are “precious items” (such as raw database or
file handles), it may be valuable to release them as soon as possible instead of relying on a garbage
collection to occur. As an alternative to overriding Finalize(), your class could implement the
IDisposable interface, which defines a single method named Dispose():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IDisposable
{
    void Dispose();
}</pre>
<p>If you are new to interface-based programming, Chapter 9 will take you through the details. In a
nutshell, an interface is a collection of abstract members a class or structure may support. When you do
support the IDisposable interface, the assumption is that when the object user is finished using the
object, the object user manually calls Dispose() before allowing the object reference to drop out of
scope. In this way, an object can perform any necessary cleanup of unmanaged resources without
incurring the hit of being placed on the finalization queue and without waiting for the garbage collector
to trigger the class’s finalization logic.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Structures and class types can both implement IDisposable (unlike overriding Finalize(), which is
reserved for class types), as the object user (not the garbage collector) invokes the Dispose() method</p>
<p>To illustrate the use of this interface, create a new C# Console Application named SimpleDispose.
Here is an updated MyResourceWrapper class that now implements IDisposable, rather than overriding
System.Object.Finalize():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Implementing IDisposable.
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyResourceWrapper : IDisposable
{
    // The <span class="kwrd">object</span> user should <span class="kwrd">call</span> this method
    // <span class="kwrd">when</span> they finish <span class="kwrd">with</span> the <span class="kwrd">object</span>.
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> void Dispose()
    {
        // Clean up unmanaged resources...

        // Dispose other contained disposable objects...

        // Just <span class="kwrd">for</span> a test.
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** In Dispose! *****"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that a Dispose() method is not only responsible for releasing the type’s unmanaged
resources, but should also call Dispose() on any other contained disposable methods. Unlike with
Finalize(), it is perfectly safe to communicate with other managed objects within a Dispose() method.
The reason is simple: the garbage collector has no clue about the IDisposable interface and will never
call Dispose(). Therefore, when the object user calls this method, the object is still living a productive life
on the managed heap and has access to all other heap-allocated objects. The calling logic is
straightforward:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Dispose *****\n"</span>);

        // Create a disposable <span class="kwrd">object</span> <span class="kwrd">and</span> <span class="kwrd">call</span> Dispose()
        // <span class="kwrd">to</span> free any internal resources.

        MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper();
        rw.Dispose();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Of course, before you attempt to call Dispose() on an object, you will want to ensure the type
supports the IDisposable interface. While you will typically know which base class library types
implement IDisposable by consulting the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation, a programmatic
check can be accomplished using the is or as keywords discussed in Chapter 6.:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Dispose *****\n"</span>);
        MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper();
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (rw <span class="kwrd">is</span> IDisposable)
            rw.Dispose();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>This example exposes yet another rule of working with garbage-collected types:</p>
<p><b>Rule</b> Always call Dispose() on any object you directly create if the object supports IDisposable. The
assumption you should make is that if the class designer chose to support the Dispose() method, the type has
some cleanup to perform.</p>
<p>There is one caveat to the previous rule. A number of types in the base class libraries that do
implement the IDisposable interface provide a (somewhat confusing) alias to the Dispose() method, in
an attempt to make the disposal-centric method sound more natural for the defining type. By way of an
example, while the System.IO.FileStream class implements IDisposable (and therefore supports a
Dispose() method), it also defines a Close() method that is used for the same purpose:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Assume you have imported
// the System.IO <span class="kwrd">namespace</span>...
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void DisposeFileStream()
{
    FileStream fs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileStream(<span class="str">"myFile.txt"</span>, FileMode.OpenOrCreate);

    // Confusing, <span class="kwrd">to</span> say the least!
    // These method calls <span class="kwrd">do</span> the same thing!
    fs.Close();
    fs.Dispose();
}</pre>
<p>While it does feel more natural to "close" a file rather than “dispose” of one, this doubling up of
disposal-centric methods can be confusing. For the few types that do provide an alias, just remember
that if a type implements IDisposable, calling Dispose() is always a correct course of action.</p>
<h2>Reusing the C# using Keyword</h2>
<p>When you are handling a managed object that implements IDisposable, it is quite common to make use
of structured exception-handling to ensure the type’s Dispose() method is called in the event of a
runtime exception:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***    ** Fun with Dispose *****\n"</span>);
    MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper ();
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        // Use the members of rw.
    }
    <span class="kwrd">finally</span>
    {
        // Always <span class="kwrd">call</span> Dispose(), <span class="kwrd">error</span> <span class="kwrd">or</span> <span class="kwrd">not</span>.
        rw.Dispose();
    }
}</pre>
<p>While this is a fine example of defensive programming, the truth of the matter is that few developers
are thrilled by the prospects of wrapping each and every disposable type within a try/finally block just
to ensure the Dispose() method is called. To achieve the same result in a much less obtrusive manner,
C# supports a special bit of syntax that looks like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Dispose *****\n"</span>);
    // Dispose() <span class="kwrd">is</span> called automatically <span class="kwrd">when</span> the
    // using scope exits.
    using(MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper())
    {
        // Use rw <span class="kwrd">object</span>.
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you looked at the CIL code of the Main() method using ildasm.exe, you would find the using
syntax does indeed expand to try/final logic, with the expected call to Dispose():</p>
    <pre class="csharpcode">
.method private hidebysig static void Main(string[] args) cil managed
{
...
	.try
	{
		...
	} // end .try
	finally
	{
...
	IL_0012: callvirt instance void
		SimpleFinalize.MyResourceWrapper::Dispose()
} // end handler
...
} // end of method Program::Main
        </pre>
<p><b>Note</b> If you attempt to “use” an object that does not implement IDisposable, you will receive a compiler error.</p>
<p>While this syntax does remove the need to manually wrap disposable objects within try/finally
logic, the C# using keyword unfortunately now has a double meaning (importing namespaces and
invoking a Dispose() method). Nevertheless, when you are working with .NET types that support the
IDisposable interface, this syntactical construct will ensure that the object “being used” will
automatically have its Dispose() method called once the using block has exited.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that it is possible to declare multiple objects of the same type within a using scope. As
you would expect, the compiler will inject code to call Dispose() on each declared object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> void Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Dispose *****\n"</span>);

    // Use a comma-delimited list <span class="kwrd">to</span> <span class="kwrd">declare</span> multiple objects <span class="kwrd">to</span> dispose.
    using(MyResourceWrapper rw = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper(),
        rw2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyResourceWrapper())
    {
        // Use rw <span class="kwrd">and</span> rw2 objects.
    }
}</pre>
