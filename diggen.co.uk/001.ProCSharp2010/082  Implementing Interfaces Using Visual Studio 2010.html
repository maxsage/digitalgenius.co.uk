    <h1>Implementing Interfaces Using Visual Studio 2010</h1>
<p>Although interface-based programming is a very powerful technique, implementing interfaces may
entail a healthy amount of typing. Given that interfaces are a named set of abstract members, you are
required to type in the definition and implementation for each interface method on each type that
supports the behavior.</p>
<p>As you would hope, Visual Studio 2010 supports various tools that make the task of implementing
interfaces less burdensome. By way of a simple test, insert a final class into your current project named
PointyTestClass. When you implement IPointy (or any interface for that matter), you might have
noticed that when you complete typing the interface’s name (or when you position the mouse cursor on
the interface name in the code window), the first letter is underlined (formally termed a smart tag).
When you click the smart tag, you will be presented with a drop-down list that allows you to implement
the interface (see Figure 9-5).</p>

<p>Notice you are presented with two options, the second of which (explicit interface implementation)
will be examined in the next section. For the time being, select the first option and you’ll see that Visual
Studio 2010 has generated stub code (within a named code region) for you to update (note that the
default implementation throws a System.NotImplementedException, which can obviously be deleted).</p>

    {
        <span class="preproc">#region</span> IPointy Members
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">byte</span> Points
        {
            <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">throw</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> NotImplementedException(); }
        }
        <span class="preproc">#endregion</span>
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note </b> Visual Studio 2010 also supports extract interface refactoring, available from the Refactor menu. This
allows you to pull out a new interface definition from an existing class definition.</p>
