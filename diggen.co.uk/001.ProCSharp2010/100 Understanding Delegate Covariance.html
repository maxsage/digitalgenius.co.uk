<h1>Understanding Delegate Covariance</h1>
  <p>As you may have noticed, each of the delegates created thus far point to methods returning simple
numerical data types (or void). However, assume you have a new Console Application named
DelegateCovariance that defines a delegate type that can point to methods returning a custom class type
(be sure to include your Car class definition in this new project):</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Define a delegate type pointing to methods that return Car objects.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> Car ObtainCarDelegate();</pre>
    <p>Of course, you would be able to define a target for the delegate as expected:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> DelegateCovariance
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="rem">// Define a delegate type pointing to methods that return Car object.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> Car ObtainCarDelegate();

        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Delegate Covariance *****\n"</span>);

            ObtainCarDelegate targetA = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObtainCarDelegate(GetBasicCar);
            Car c = targetA();
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Obtained a {0}"</span>, c);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }

        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Car GetBasicCar()
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Zippy"</span>, 100, 55);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, what if you were to derive a new class from the Car type named SportsCar and you wanted to
create a delegate type that can point to methods returning this class type? Prior to .NET 2.0, you would
be required to define an entirely new delegate to do so, given that delegates were so type-safe that they
did not honor the basic laws of inheritance:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Define a new delegate type pointing to</span>
<span class="rem">// methods that return a SportsCar object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> SportsCar ObtainSportsCarDelegate();</pre>
<p>As we now have two delegate types, we must create an instance of each to obtain Car and SportsCar
types:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> Car ObtainCarDelegate();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> SportsCar ObtainSportsCarDelegate();

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Car GetBasicCar()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> SportsCar GetSportsCar()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar(); }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Delegate Covariance *****\n"</span>);
        
        ObtainCarDelegate targetA = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObtainCarDelegate(GetBasicCar);
        Car c = targetA();
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Obtained a {0}"</span>, c);

        ObtainSportsCarDelegate targetB =
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObtainSportsCarDelegate(GetSportsCar);
        SportsCar sc = targetB();
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Obtained a {0}"</span>, sc);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Given the laws of classic inheritance, it would be ideal to build a single delegate type that can point
to methods returning either Car or SportsCar objects (after all, a SportsCar “is-a” Car). Covariance (which
also goes by the term relaxed delegates) allows for this very possibility. Simply put, covariance allows you
to build a single delegate that can point to methods returning class types related by classical inheritance.</p>
<p><b>Note </b>In a similar vein, contravariance allows you to create a single delegate that can point to numerous
methods that receive objects related by classical inheritance. Consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation
for further details.</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="rem">// Define a single delegate type that can point to</span>
    <span class="rem">// methods that return a Car or SportsCar.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> Car ObtainVehicleDelegate();
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> Car GetBasicCar()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(); }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> SportsCar GetSportsCar()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> SportsCar(); }

    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Delegate Covariance *****\n"</span>);
        ObtainVehicleDelegate targetA = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObtainVehicleDelegate(GetBasicCar);
        Car c = targetA();
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Obtained a {0}"</span>, c);

        <span class="rem">// Covariance allows this target assignment.</span>
        ObtainVehicleDelegate targetB = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ObtainVehicleDelegate(GetSportsCar);
        SportsCar sc = (SportsCar)targetB();
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Obtained a {0}"</span>, sc);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the ObtainVehicleDelegate delegate type has been defined to point to methods
returning a strongly typed Car type. Given covariance, however, we can point to methods returning
derived types as well. To obtain access to the members of the derived type, simply perform an explicit
cast.</p>
