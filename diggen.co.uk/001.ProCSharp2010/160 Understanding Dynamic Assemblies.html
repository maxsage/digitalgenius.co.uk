<h1>Understanding Dynamic Assemblies</h1>
    <p>To be sure, the process of building a complex .NET application in CIL would be quite the labor of love.
On the one hand, CIL is an extremely expressive programming language that allows you to interact with
all of the programming constructs allowed by the CTS. On the other hand, authoring raw CIL is tedious,
error-prone, and painful. While it is true that knowledge is power, you may indeed wonder just how
important it is to commit the laws of CIL syntax to memory. The answer is, “It depends.” To be sure,
most of your .NET programming endeavors will not require you to view, edit, or author CIL code.
However, with the CIL primer behind you, you are now ready to investigate the world of dynamic
assemblies (as opposed to static assemblies) and the role of the System.Reflection.Emit namespace.</p>
<p>The first question you may have is, “What exactly is the difference between static and dynamic
assemblies?” By definition, static assemblies are .NET binaries loaded directly from disk storage,
meaning they are located somewhere on your hard drive in a physical file (or possibly a set of files in the
case of a multifile assembly) at the time the CLR requests them. As you might guess, every time you
compile your C# source code, you end up with a static assembly.</p>
<p>A dynamic assembly, on the other hand, is created in memory on the fly using the types provided by
the System.Reflection.Emit namespace. The System.Reflection.Emit namespace makes it possible to
create an assembly and its modules, type definitions, and CIL implementation logic at runtime. Once
you have done so, you are then free to save your in-memory binary to disk. This, of course, results in a
new static assembly. To be sure, the process of building a dynamic assembly using the
System.Reflection.Emit namespace does require some level of understanding regarding the nature of
CIL opcodes.</p>
<p>Although creating dynamic assemblies is a fairly advanced (and uncommon) programming task,
they can be useful under various circumstances:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You are building a .NET programming tool that needs to generate assemblies on
demand based on user input.</li>
 <li>You are building a program that needs to generate proxies to remote types on the
fly based on the obtained metadata.</li>
 <li>You wish to load a static assembly and dynamically insert new types into the
binary image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several aspects of the .NET runtime engine involve generating dynamic assemblies quietly in the
background. For example, ASP.NET makes use of this technique to map markup and server-side script
code into a runtime object model. LINQ also can generate code on the fly based on various query
expressions. This being said, let’s check out the types within System.Reflection.Emit.</p>
<h2>Exploring the System.Reflection.Emit Namespace</h2>
<p>Creating a dynamic assembly requires you to have some familiarity with CIL opcodes, but the types of
the System.Reflection.Emit namespace hide the complexity of CIL as much as possible. For example,
rather than directly specifying the necessary CIL directives and attributes to define a class type, you can
simply make use of the TypeBuilder class. Likewise, if you wish to define a new instance-level constructor,
you have no need to emit the specialname, rtspecialname, or .ctor tokens; rather, you can make use of
the ConstructorBuilder. Table 17-8 documents the key members of the System.Reflection.Emit
namespace.</p>

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>In general, the types of the System.Reflection.Emit namespace allow you to represent raw CIL
tokens programmatically during the construction of your dynamic assembly. You will see many of these
members in the example that follows; however, the ILGenerator type is worth checking out straightaway.</p>
<h2>The Role of the System.Reflection.Emit.ILGenerator</h2>
<p>As its name implies, the ILGenerator type’s role is to inject CIL opcodes into a given type member.
However, you cannot directly create ILGenerator objects, as this type has no public constructors, rather
you receive an ILGenerator type by calling specific methods of the builder-centric types (such as the
MethodBuilder and ConstructorBuilder types), for example:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// Obtain an ILGenerator from a ConstructorBuilder
// object named "myCtorBuilder".
ConstructorBuilder myCtorBuilder =
    new ConstructorBuilder(/* ...various args... */);

ILGenerator myCILGen = myCtorBuilder.GetILGenerator();</pre>
<p>Once you have an ILGenerator in your hands, you are then able to emit the raw CIL opcodes using
any number of methods. Table 17-9 documents some (but not all) methods of ILGenerator.</p>

 </table>
<p>The key method of ILGenerator is Emit(), which works in conjunction with the
System.Reflection.Emit.OpCodes class type. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, this type exposes a
good number of read-only fields that map to raw CIL opcodes. The full set of these members are all
documented within online help, and you will see various examples in the pages that follow.</p>
<h2>Emitting a Dynamic Assembly</h2>
<p>To illustrate the process of defining a .NET assembly at runtime, let’s walk through the process of
creating a single-file dynamic assembly named MyAssembly.dll. Within this module is a class named
HelloWorld. The HelloWorld class supports a default constructor and a custom constructor that is used to
assign the value of a private member variable (theMessage) of type string. In addition, HelloWorld
supports a public instance method named SayHello(), which prints a greeting to the standard I/O
stream, and another instance method named GetMsg(), which returns the internal private string. In
effect, you are going to programmatically generate the following class type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This class will be created at runtime</span>
<span class="rem">// using System.Reflection.Emit.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> HelloWorld
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> theMessage;
    HelloWorld() {}
    HelloWorld(<span class="kwrd">string</span> s) {theMessage = s;}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> GetMsg() {<span class="kwrd">return</span> theMessage;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SayHello()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello from the HelloWorld class!"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Assume you have created a new Visual Studio 2010 Console Application project workspace named
DynamicAsmBuilder and import the System.Reflection, System.Reflection.Emit, and
-System.Threading namespaces. Define a static method named CreateMyAsm(). This single method is in
charge of the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Defining the characteristics of the dynamic assembly (name, version, etc.)</li>
 <li>Implementing the HelloClass type</li>
 <li>Saving the in-memory assembly to a physical file</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that the CreateMyAsm() method takes as a single parameter a System.AppDomain type,
which will be used to obtain access to the AssemblyBuilder type associated with the current application
domain (see Chapter 17 for a discussion of .NET application domains). Here is the complete code, with
analysis to follow:</p>

<h2>Emitting the Assembly and Module Set</h2>
<p>The method body begins by establishing the minimal set of characteristics about your assembly, using
the AssemblyName and Version types (defined in the System.Reflection namespace). Next, you obtain an
AssemblyBuilder type via the instance-level AppDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly() method (recall the
caller will pass in an AppDomain reference into the CreateMyAsm() method):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Establish general assembly characteristics</span>
<span class="rem">// and gain access to the AssemblyBuilder type.</span>

    assemblyName.Name = <span class="str">"MyAssembly"</span>;
    assemblyName.Version = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Version(<span class="str">"1.0.0.0"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Create new assembly within the current AppDomain.</span>
    AssemblyBuilder assembly =
        curAppDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly(assemblyName,
        AssemblyBuilderAccess.Save);
...
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, when calling AppDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly(), you must specify the access
mode of the assembly you wish to define, which can be any of the values shown in Table 17-10.</p>

<p>The next task is to define the module set for your new assembly. Given that the assembly is a single
file unit, you need to define only a single module. If you were to build a multi-file assembly using the
DefineDynamicModule() method, you would specify an optional second parameter that represents the name
of a given module (e.g., myMod.dotnetmodule). However, when creating a single-file assembly, the name of
the module will be identical to the name of the assembly itself. In any case, once the DefineDynamicModule()
method has returned, you are provided with a reference to a valid ModuleBuilder type:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
// The single-file assembly.
ModuleBuilder module =
    assembly.DefineDynamicModule("MyAssembly", "MyAssembly.dll");
</pre>
 <h2>The Role of the ModuleBuilder Type</h2>
 <p>ModuleBuilder is the key type used during the development of dynamic assemblies. As you would expect,
ModuleBuilder supports a number of members that allow you to define the set of types contained within
a given module (classes, interfaces, structures, etc.) as well as the set of embedded resources (string
tables, images, etc.) contained within. Table 17-11 describes a few of the creation-centric methods. (Do
note that each method will return to you a related type that represents the type you wish to construct.)</p>

  </tr>
 </table>
<p>The key member of the ModuleBuilder class to be aware of is DefineType(). In addition to specifying
the name of the type (via a simple string), you will also make use of the
System.Reflection.TypeAttributes enum to describe the format of the type itself. Table 17-12 lists some
(but not all) of the key members of the TypeAttributes enumeration.</p>

<h2>Emitting the HelloClass Type and the String Member Variable</h2>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of the role of the ModuleBuilder.CreateType() method, let’s
examine how you can emit the public HelloWorld class type and the private string variable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Define a public class named "MyAssembly.HelloWorld".</span>
TypeBuilder helloWorldClass = module.DefineType(<span class="str">"MyAssembly.HelloWorld"</span>,
    TypeAttributes.Public);

    <span class="rem">// Define a private String member variable named "theMessage".</span>
FieldBuilder msgField =
    helloWorldClass.DefineField(<span class="str">"theMessage"</span>,
    <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>),
    FieldAttributes.Private);</pre>
 <p>Notice how the TypeBuilder.DefineField() method provides access to a FieldBuilder type. The
TypeBuilder class also defines other methods that provide access to other “builder” types. For example,
DefineConstructor() returns a ConstructorBuilder, DefineProperty() returns a PropertyBuilder, and so forth.</p>
<h2>Emitting the Constructors</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the TypeBuilder.DefineConstructor() method can be used to define a
-constructor for the current type. However, when it comes to implementing the constructor of
-HelloClass, you need to inject raw CIL code into the constructor body, which is responsible for
assigning the incoming parameter to the internal private string. To obtain an ILGenerator type, you call
the GetILGenerator() method from the respective “builder” type you have reference to (in this case, the
ConstructorBuilder type).</p>
<p>The Emit() method of the ILGenerator class is the entity in charge of placing CIL into a member
implementation. Emit() itself makes frequent use of the OpCodes class type, which exposes the opcode
set of CIL using read-only fields. For example, OpCodes.Ret signals the return of a method call.
OpCodes.Stfld makes an assignment to a member variable. OpCodes.Call is used to call a given method
(in this case, the base class constructor). That said, ponder the following constructor logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Create the custom constructor taking</span>
<span class="rem">// a single System.String argument.</span>
Type[] constructorArgs = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Type[1];
constructorArgs[0] = <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span>);
ConstructorBuilder constructor =
    helloWorldClass.DefineConstructor(MethodAttributes.Public,
    CallingConventions.Standard, constructorArgs);

<span class="rem">// Now emit the necessary CIL into the ctor.</span>
ILGenerator constructorIL = constructor.GetILGenerator();
constructorIL.Emit(OpCodes.Ldarg_0);
Type objectClass = <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(<span class="kwrd">object</span>);
ConstructorInfo superConstructor = objectClass.GetConstructor(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Type[0]);
constructorIL.Emit(OpCodes.Call, superConstructor); <span class="rem">// Call base class ctor.</span>

<span class="rem">// Load the object's "this" pointer on the stack.</span>
constructorIL.Emit(OpCodes.Ldarg_0);

<span class="rem">// Load incoming argument on virtual stack and store in msgField.</span>
constructorIL.Emit(OpCodes.Ldarg_1);
constructorIL.Emit(OpCodes.Stfld, msgField); <span class="rem">// Assign msgField.</span>
constructorIL.Emit(OpCodes.Ret); <span class="rem">// Return.</span></pre>
<h2>Emitting the SayHello() Method</h2>
<p>Last but not least, let’s examine the process of emitting the SayHello() method. The first task is to obtain
a MethodBuilder type from the helloWorldClass variable. Once you do this, you define the method and
obtain the underlying ILGenerator to inject the CIL instructions:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Create the SayHello method.</span>
MethodBuilder sayHiMethod =
    helloWorldClass.DefineMethod(<span class="str">"SayHello"</span>,
    MethodAttributes.Public, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="kwrd">null</span>);
methodIL = sayHiMethod.GetILGenerator();

<span class="rem">// Write a line to the Console.</span>
methodIL.EmitWriteLine(<span class="str">"Hello there!"</span>);
methodIL.Emit(OpCodes.Ret);</pre>
<p>Here you have established a public method (MethodAttributes.Public) that takes no parameters
and returns nothing (marked by the null entries contained in the DefineMethod() call). Also note the
EmitWriteLine() call. This helper member of the ILGenerator class automatically writes a line to the
standard output with minimal fuss and bother.</p>
<h2>Using the Dynamically Generated Assembly</h2>
<p>Now that you have the logic in place to create and save your assembly, all that’s needed is a class to
trigger the logic. To come full circle, assume your current project defines a second class named
AsmReader. The logic in Main() obtains the current AppDomain via the Thread.GetDomain() method that
will be used to host the assembly you will dynamically create. Once you have a reference, you are able to
call the CreateMyAsm() method.</p>
<p>To make things a bit more interesting, once the call to CreateMyAsm() returns, you will exercise some
late binding (see Chapter 15) to load your newly created assembly into memory and interact with the
members of the HelloWorld class. Update your Main() method as follows:</p>

<p>In effect, you have just created a .NET assembly that is able to create and execute .NET assemblies at
runtime! That wraps up the examination of CIL and the role of dynamic assemblies. I hope this chapter
has deepened your understanding of the .NET type system and the syntax and semantics of CIL.</p>
