<h1>Interacting with the Outgoing HTTP Response</h1>
    <p>Now that you have a better understanding of how the Page type allows you to interact with the incoming
HTTP request, the next step is to see how to interact with the outgoing HTTP response. In ASP.NET, the
Response property of the Page class provides access to an instance of the HttpResponse type. This type
defines a number of properties that allow you to format the HTTP response sent back to the client
browser. Table 32-6 lists some core properties.</p>

<h2>Emitting HTML Content</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most well-known aspect of the HttpResponse type is the ability to write content directly to
the HTTP output stream. The HttpResponse.Write() method allows you to pass in any HTML tags
and/or text literals. The HttpResponse.WriteFile() method takes this functionality one step further, in
that you can specify the name of a physical file on the web server whose contents should be rendered to
the output stream (this is quite helpful to quickly emit the contents of an existing *.htm file).</p>
<p>To illustrate, assume you have added another Button type to your current *.aspx file that
implements the server-side Click event handler like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnHttpResponse_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Response.Write(<span class="str">"&lt;b&gt;My name is:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"</span>);
    Response.Write(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString());
    Response.Write(<span class="str">"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here was your last request:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"</span>);
    Response.WriteFile(<span class="str">"MyHTMLPage.htm"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>The role of this helper function (which you can assume is called by some server-side event handler)
is quite simple. The only point of interest is the fact that the HttpResponse.WriteFile() method is now
emitting the contents of a server-side *.htm file within the root directory of the website.</p>
<p>Again, while you can always take this old-school approach and render HTML tags and content using
the Write() method, this approach is far less common under ASP.NET than with classic ASP. The reason
is (once again) due to the advent of server-side web controls. Thus, if you wish to render a block of
textual data to the browser, your task is as simple as assigning a string to the Text property of a Label
widget.</p>
<h2>Redirecting Users</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the HttpResponse type is the ability to redirect the user to a new URL:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnWasteTime_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Response.Redirect(<span class="str">"http://www.facebook.com"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>If this event handler is invoked via a client-side postback, the user will automatically be redirected
to the specified URL.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The HttpResponse.Redirect() method will always entail a trip back to the client browser. If you
simply wish to transfer control to an *.aspx file in the same virtual directory, the
HttpServerUtility.Transfer() method, accessed via the inherited Server property, is more efficient.</p>
<p>So much for investigating the functionality of System.Web.UI.Page. I will examine the role of the
System.Web.UI.Control base class in the next chapter. Next up, let’s examine the life and times of a Pagederived
object.</p>
