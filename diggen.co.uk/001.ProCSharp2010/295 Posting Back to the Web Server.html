<h1>Posting Back to the Web Server</h1>
    <p>This simple HTML page is executing all functionality within the hosting browser. A real web page needs
to post back to a resource on the web server, passing all of the input data at the same time. Once the
server side resource receives this data, it can use it to build a proper HTTP response.</p>
<p>The action attribute on the opening &lt;form&gt; tag specifies the recipient of the incoming form data.
Possible receivers include mail servers, other HTML files on the web server, a classic (COM-based) Active
Server Pages (ASP) file, an ASP.NET web page, and so forth.</p>
<p>Beyond the action attribute, you will also likely have a submit button, which when clicked, will
transmit the form data to the web application via an HTTP request. You have no need to do so for this
example; however, here is an update to the default.htm file, specifying the following attribute in the
opening &lt;form&gt; tag:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">form</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="defaultPage"</span>
    <span class="attr">action</span><span class="kwrd">="http://localhost/Cars/ClassicAspPage.asp"</span> <span class="attr">method</span><span class="kwrd">="GET"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="btnPostBack"</span> <span class="attr">type</span><span class="kwrd">="submit"</span> <span class="attr">value</span><span class="kwrd">="Post to Server!"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
...
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">form</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>When the submit button for this form is clicked, the form data is sent to the ClassicAspPage.asp at
the specified URL. When you specify method="GET" as the mode of transmission, the form data is
appended to the query string as a set of name/value pairs separated by ampersands. You may have seen
this sort of data in your browser before, for example:</p>
<pre>
 http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=vikings&cts=1264370773666&aq=f&aql=&aqi=g1g-z1g1g-z1g1g-z1g4&oq=
</pre>
<p>The other method of transmitting form data to the web server is to specify method="POST":</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">form</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="defaultPage"</span>
    <span class="attr">action</span><span class="kwrd">="http://localhost/Cars/ClassicAspPage.asp"</span> <span class="attr">method</span> = <span class="kwrd">"POST"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
...
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">form</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>In this case, the form data is not appended to the query string. Using POST, the form data is not
directly visible to the outside world. More important, POST data does not have a character-length
limitation; many browsers have a limit for GET queries.</p>
<h2>Postbacks under ASP.NET</h2>
<p>When you are building ASP.NET based web sites, the framework will take care of the posting mechanics
on your behalf. One of the many benefits of building a web site using ASP.NET is that the programming
model layers on top of standard HTTP Request/Response an event driven system. Thus, rather than
manually setting an action attribute and defining an HTML submit button, you can simply handle events
on the ASP.NET web controls using standard C# syntax.</p>
<p>Using this event driven model, you can very easily post back to the web server using a large number
of controls. If you require, you can post back to the web server if the user clicks on a radio button, an
item in a list box, a day on a calendar control, and so on. In each case, you simply handle the correct
event, and the ASP.NET runtime will automatically emit back the correct HTML posting data.</p>
