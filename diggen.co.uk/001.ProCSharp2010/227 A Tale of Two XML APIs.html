<h1>A Tale of Two XML APIs</h1>
    <p>When the .NET platform was first introduced, programmers were able to manipulate XML documents
using the types within the System.Xml.dll assembly. Using the contained namespaces and types, you
were able to generate XML data in memory and save it to disk storage. As well, the System.Xml.dll
assembly provided types allowing you to load XML documents into memory, search an XML document
for specific nodes, validate a document against a given schema, and other common programming tasks.</p>
<p>While this original library has been used successfully in many .NET projects, working with these
types was a tad bit cumbersome (to put it politely), as the programming model bore no relationship to
the structure of the XML document itself. For example, assume you needed to build an XML file in
memory and save it to the file system. If you were to use the types of System.Xml.dll, you might author
code like the following (if you want to follow along, create a new Console Application project named
LinqToXmlFirstLook, and import the System.Xml namespace):</p>

{
    <span class="rem">// Make a new XML document in memory.</span>
    XmlDocument doc = <span class="kwrd">new</span> XmlDocument();

    <span class="rem">// Fill this document with a root element</span>
    <span class="rem">// named &lt;Inventory&gt;.</span>
    XmlElement inventory = doc.CreateElement(<span class="str">"Inventory"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Now, make a sub element named &lt;Car&gt; with</span>
    <span class="rem">// an ID attribute.</span>
    XmlElement car = doc.CreateElement(<span class="str">"Car"</span>);
    car.SetAttribute(<span class="str">"ID"</span>, <span class="str">"1000"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Build the data within the &lt;Car&gt; element.</span>
    XmlElement name = doc.CreateElement(<span class="str">"PetName"</span>);
    name.InnerText = <span class="str">"Jimbo"</span>;
    XmlElement color = doc.CreateElement(<span class="str">"Color"</span>);
    color.InnerText = <span class="str">"Red"</span>;
    XmlElement make = doc.CreateElement(<span class="str">"Make"</span>);
    make.InnerText = <span class="str">"Ford"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Add &lt;PetName&gt;, &lt;Color&gt; and &lt;Make&gt; to the &lt;Car&gt;</span>
    <span class="rem">// element.</span>
    car.AppendChild(name);
    car.AppendChild(color);
    car.AppendChild(make);

    <span class="rem">// Add the &lt;Car&gt; element to the &lt;Inventory&gt; element.</span>
    inventory.AppendChild(car);

    <span class="rem">// Insert the complete XML into the XmlDocument object,</span>
    <span class="rem">// and save to file.</span>
    doc.AppendChild(inventory);
    doc.Save(<span class="str">"Inventory.xml"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>If you were to call this method, you could be able to see that the Inventory.xml file (located in the
bin\Debug folder) contains the following data:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Inventory</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Car</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="1000"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">PetName</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Jimbo<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">PetName</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Color</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Red<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Color</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>

    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Car</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Inventory</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>While this method works as expected, a few observations are in order. First, the programming model
of System.Xml.dll is Microsoft’s implementation of the W3C Document Object Model (DOM)
specification. Under this model, an XML document is created from the bottom up. First you create a
document, then you create sub-elements, and finally you add the elements to the document. To account
for this in code, you need to author quite a bit of function calls off the XmlDocument, and XmlElement
classes (among others).</p>
<p>For this example, it took 16 lines of code (not including code comments) to build even this very
simple XML document. If you needed to build a more complex document with the System.Xml.dll
assembly, you could end up with a great deal of code. While you could certainly streamline this code, by
building nodes via various looping or decision constructs, the fact remains that the body of code has
little visual indicators regarding the final XML tree.</p>
<h2>LINQ to XML As a Better DOM</h2>
<p>The LINQ to XML API is an alternative manner to create, manipulate, and query XML documents, which
uses a much more functional approach than the System.Xml DOM model. Rather than building an XML
document by assembling elements individually and updating the XML tree through a set of function
calls, you can author top-down code such as the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> BuildXmlDocWithLINQToXml()
{
    <span class="rem">// Create a XML document in a more 'functional' manner.</span>
    XElement doc =
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> XElement(<span class="str">"Inventory"</span>,
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> XElement(<span class="str">"Car"</span>, <span class="kwrd">new</span> XAttribute(<span class="str">"ID"</span>, <span class="str">"1000"</span>),
                <span class="kwrd">new</span> XElement(<span class="str">"PetName"</span>, <span class="str">"Jimbo"</span>),
                <span class="kwrd">new</span> XElement(<span class="str">"Color"</span>, <span class="str">"Red"</span>),
                <span class="kwrd">new</span> XElement(<span class="str">"Make"</span>, <span class="str">"Ford"</span>)
            )    
        );

    <span class="rem">// Save to file.</span>
    doc.Save(<span class="str">"InventoryWithLINQ.xml"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>Here, you are using a new set of types from the System.Xml.Linq namespace, specifically XElement
and XAttribute. If you were to call this method, you will find the same XML data has been created, this
time with much less fuss and bother. Notice how, through some careful indentation, your source code
has the same overall structure of the resulting XML document. This is very useful in and of itself, but also
notice that you have a much smaller body of code than the previous example (based on how you space
your code, you saved about 10 lines!)</p>
<p>Here, you have not made use of any LINQ query expressions, but have simply used the types of the
System.Xml.Linq namespace to generate an in-memory XML document which is then saved to file.
Effectively, you have used LINQ to XML as a better DOM. As you will see later in this chapter, the classes
of System.Xml.Linq are LINQ-aware, and can be the target for the same sort of LINQ queries you learned
about in Chapter 13.</p>
<p>As you learn more about LINQ to XML, you will most likely find it much easier to work with than the
initial XML libraries of .NET. However, this is not to say you will never use the namespaces of the original
System.Xml.dll library. But chances are the times you will opt to use System.Xml.dll for new projects
will be significantly reduced.</p>
<h2>VB Literal Syntax As a Better LINQ to XML</h2>
<p>Before you begin your formal examination into LINQ to XML as seen through C#, I do want to briefly
mention that the Visual Basic language takes the functional approach of this API to the next level. In VB,
you can define XML literals, which allow you to assign an XElement to a stream of inline XML markup,
directly in code. Assuming you had a VB project, you could build the following method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Class</span> XmlLiteralExample
    <span class="kwrd">Public</span> <span class="kwrd">Sub</span> MakeXmlFileUsingLiterals()
        <span class="rem">' Notice that we can inline XML data</span>
        <span class="rem">' to an XElement.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">Dim</span> doc <span class="kwrd">As</span> XElement = _
            &lt;Inventory&gt;
                &lt;Car ID=<span class="str">"1000"</span>&gt;
                    &lt;PetName&gt;Jimbo&lt;/PetName&gt;
                    &lt;Color&gt;Red&lt;/Color&gt;
                    &lt;Make&gt;Ford&lt;/Make&gt;
                &lt;/Car&gt;
            &lt;/Inventory&gt;
        <span class="rem">' Save to file.</span>
        doc.Save(<span class="str">"InventoryVBStyle.xml"</span>)
    <span class="kwrd">End</span> <span class="kwrd">Sub</span>
<span class="kwrd">End</span> Class</pre>
<p>Once the VB compiler processes the XML literal, it will map the XML data into the correct
underlying LINQ to XML object model. In fact, when you are working with LINQ to XML within a VB
project, the IDE already understands that your XML literal syntax is just a shorthand notation for the
related code. In Figure 24-1, notice how you can apply the dot operator to the &lt;/Inventory&gt; end tag and
see the same members as you would find if you apply the dot operator to a strongly typed XElement.</p>

<p><b>Figure 24-1</b> VB XML literal syntax is a shorthand notation for working with the LINQ to XML object model</p>
<p>Although this book is about the C# programming language, few developers can argue that VB’s XML
support is quite awesome. Even if you are the sort of developer who can’t imagine using a language from
the BASIC family for your data to day development, I encourage you to check out VB literal syntax using
the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation. You may find yourself isolating your XML data
manipulation routines to a dedicated *.dll, just so you can make use of VB to do so!</p>
