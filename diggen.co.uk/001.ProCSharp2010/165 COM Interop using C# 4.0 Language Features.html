<h1>COM Interop using C# 4.0 Language Features</h1>
<p>Assume you have a Windows Form GUI application (named ExportDataToOfficeApp), whose main Form
defines a DataGridView named dataGridCars. This same form has two Button controls, one of which will
bring up a dialog box to insert a new row of data to the grid, and the other of which needs to export the
grid’s data to an Excel spreadsheet. Given the fact that the Excel application exposes a programming
model via COM, you can hook into this object model using the interoperability layer. Figure 18-9 shows
the completed GUI.</p>

<p><b>Figure 18-9</b> The GUI of the COM interop example</p>
<p>You will fill the grid with some initial data by handling the form’s Load event as so (the Car class used
as the type parameter for the generic List&lt;T&gt; is a simple class in the project with Color, Make, and
PetName properties):</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    List&lt;Car&gt; carsInStock = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MainForm()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MainForm_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        carsInStock = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;Car&gt;
        {
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car {Color=<span class="str">"Green"</span>, Make=<span class="str">"VW"</span>, PetName=<span class="str">"Mary"</span>},
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car {Color=<span class="str">"Red"</span>, Make=<span class="str">"Saab"</span>, PetName=<span class="str">"Mel"</span>},
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car {Color=<span class="str">"Black"</span>, Make=<span class="str">"Ford"</span>, PetName=<span class="str">"Hank"</span>},
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car {Color=<span class="str">"Yellow"</span>, Make=<span class="str">"BMW"</span>, PetName=<span class="str">"Davie"</span>}
        };
        UpdateGrid();
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> UpdateGrid()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Reset the source of data.</span>
        dataGridCars.DataSource = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
        dataGridCars.DataSource = carsInStock;
    }
}</pre>
<p>The Click event for the “Add” button will launch a custom dialog box to allow the user to enter new
data for a Car object, and if they click the OK button, the data is added to the grid. I won’t bother to show
the code behind the dialog box, so please see the provided solution for details. If you are following
however, include the NewCarDialog.cs, NewCarDialog.designer.cs and NewCarDialog.resx files into your
project (all of which are part of the code download for this text). Once you have done so, implement the
“Add” button click hander as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnAddNewCar_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    NewCarDialog d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> NewCarDialog();
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (d.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Add new car to list.</span>
        carsInStock.Add(d.theCar);
        UpdateGrid();
    }
}</pre>
<p>The Click event handler for the , “Export” button is the heart of this example. Using the .NET tab of
the Add Reference… dialog box, add a reference to the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll primary
interop assembly (as shown previously in Figure 18-7). Add the following namespace alias to the form’s
primary code file. Be aware that this is not mandatory to define an alias when interacting with COM
libraries. However, by doing so, you have a handy qualifier for all of the imported COM objects, which is
very handy if some of these COM objects have names which would clash with your .NET types:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Create an alias to the Excel object model.</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;</pre>
<p>Implement this button Click event hander to call a private helper function named ExportToExcel():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnExportToExcel_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ExportToExcel(carsInStock);
}</pre>
<p>Because you imported the COM library using Visual Studio 2010, the PIA has been automatically
configured so that the used metadata will be embedded into the .NET application (recall the role of the
Embed Interop Types property). Therefore, all COM Variants are realized as dynamic data types.
Furthermore, because you are compiling your code with C# 4.0, you can make use of optional arguments
and named arguments. This being said consider the following implementation of ExportToExcel():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExportToExcel(List&lt;Car&gt; carsInStock)
{
    <span class="rem">// Load up Excel, then make a new empty workbook.</span>
    Excel.Application excelApp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Excel.Application();

    <span class="rem">// This example uses a single workSheet.</span>
    Excel._Worksheet workSheet = excelApp.ActiveSheet;

    <span class="rem">// Establish column headings in cells.</span>
    workSheet.Cells[1, <span class="str">"A"</span>] = <span class="str">"Make"</span>;
    workSheet.Cells[1, <span class="str">"B"</span>] = <span class="str">"Color"</span>;
    workSheet.Cells[1, <span class="str">"C"</span>] = <span class="str">"Pet Name"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Now, map all data in List&lt;Car&gt; to the cells of the spread sheet.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> row = 1;
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carsInStock)
    {
        row++;
        workSheet.Cells[row, <span class="str">"A"</span>] = c.Make;
        workSheet.Cells[row, <span class="str">"B"</span>] = c.Color;
        workSheet.Cells[row, <span class="str">"C"</span>] = c.PetName;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Give our table data a nice look and feel.</span>
    workSheet.Range[<span class="str">"A1"</span>].AutoFormat(
        Excel.XlRangeAutoFormat.xlRangeAutoFormatClassic2);

    <span class="rem">// Save the file, quit Excel and display message to user.</span>
    workSheet.SaveAs(<span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">@"{0}\Inventory.xlsx"</span>, Environment.CurrentDirectory));
    excelApp.Quit();
    MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"The Inventory.xslx file has been saved to your app folder"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Export complete!"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>This method begins by loading Excel into memory, however you won’t see it visible on your
computer desktop. For this application, you are only interested in using the internal Excel object model.
However, if you do want to actually display the UI of Excel, update your method with this additional line
of code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExportToExcel(List&lt;Car&gt; carsInStock)
{
    <span class="rem">// Load up Excel, then make a new empty workbook.</span>
    Excel.Application excelApp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Excel.Application();

    <span class="rem">// Go ahead and make Excel visible on the computer.</span>
    excelApp.Visible = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
...
}</pre>
<p>Once you create an empty worksheet, you add three columns which are named similar to the
properties of the Car class. After this point, you fill the cells with the data of the List&lt;Car&gt;, and save your
file under the (hard coded) name Inventory.xlsx.</p>
<p>At this point if you run your application, add a few new records, and export your data to Excel, you
will then be able to open up the Inventory.xlsx file, which will be saved to the \bin\Debug folder of your
Windows Forms application. Figure 18-10 shows a possible export.</p>

<h2>COM interop without C# 4.0 Language Features</h2>
<p>Now, if you were to select the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll assembly (in Solution Explorer), and
set its Embed Interop Type property to False, you would have new compiler errors, as the COM Variant
data is no longer realized as dynamic data, but as System.Object variables. This will require you to
update ExportToExcel() with a number of casting operations. As well, if this project were compiled
under Visual Studio 2008, you no longer have the benefit of optional/named parameters, and must
explicitly marked all missing arguments. Here is a version of the ExportToExcel() method which would
be required in earlier versions of C#:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ExportToExcel2008(List&lt;Car&gt; carsInStock)
{

    excelApp.Workbooks.Add(Type.Missing);

    <span class="rem">// Must cast Object as _Worksheet!</span>

        ((Excel.Range)workSheet.Cells[row, <span class="str">"C"</span>]).Value2 = c.PetName;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Must call get_Range method and then specify all missing args!.</span>
    excelApp.get_Range(<span class="str">"A1"</span>, Type.Missing).AutoFormat(
        Excel.XlRangeAutoFormat.xlRangeAutoFormatClassic2,
        Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,
        Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing);

    <span class="rem">// Must specify all missing optional args!</span>
    workSheet.SaveAs(<span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">@"{0}\Inventory.xlsx"</span>, Environment.CurrentDirectory),
        Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,
        Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing);

    excelApp.Quit();
    MessageBox.Show(<span class="str">"The Inventory.xslx file has been saved to your app folder"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Export complete!"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>While the end result is identical, as I am sure you agree, this version of the method is much more
verbose. As well, since earlier versions of C# (prior to .NET 4.0, to be specific) don’t allow you to embedd
the COM interop data, you would find that your output directory now contains local copies of a number
of interop assemblies, which you would be required to ship to the end user’s machine (Figure 18-11).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure18_11.png" alt="Figure 18-11" />
<p>Figure 18-11. Not embedding interop data requires you to ship standalone interoperability assemblies
That wraps up our look at the C# dynamic keyword and the DLR. Hopefully you can see how these
new .NET 4.0 features can simplify complex programming tasks, and (perhaps more importantly)
understand the trade offs. When you opt into dynamic data, you do lose a good amount of type safety,
and your code base is prone to many more runtime errors.</p>
