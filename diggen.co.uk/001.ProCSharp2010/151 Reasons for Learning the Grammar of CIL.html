<h1>Reasons for Learning the Grammar of CIL</h1>
    <p>CIL is the true mother tongue of the .NET platform. When you build a .NET assembly using your
managed language of choice (C#, VB, F#, COBOL.NET, etc.), the associated compiler translates your
source code into terms of CIL. Like any programming language, CIL provides numerous structural and
implementation-centric tokens. Given that CIL is just another .NET programming language, it should
come as no surprise that it is possible to build your .NET assemblies directly using CIL and the CIL
compiler (ilasm.exe) that ships with the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK.</p>
<p>Now while it is true that few programmers would choose to build an entire .NET application directly
with CIL, CIL is still an extremely interesting intellectual pursuit. Simply put, the more you understand the
grammar of CIL, the better able you are to move into the realm of advanced .NET development. By way
of some concrete examples, individuals who possess an understanding of CIL are capable of the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Talking intelligently about how different .NET programming languages map their
respective keywords to CIL tokens.</li>
 <li>Disassembling an existing .NET assembly, editing the CIL code, and recompiling
the updated code base into a modified .NET binary. For example, there are some
scenarios where you might need to modify CIL in order to interoperate with some
advanced COM features.</li>
 <li>Building dynamic assemblies using the System.Reflection.Emit namespace. This
API allows you to generate an in-memory .NET assembly, which can optionally be
persisted to disk.</li>
 <li>Leveraging aspects of the CTS that are not supported by higher-level managed
languages, but do exist at the level of CIL. To be sure, CIL is the only .NET
language that allows you to access each and every aspect of the CTS. For example,
using raw CIL, you are able to define global-level members and fields (which are
not permissible in C#).</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, to be perfectly clear, if you choose not to concern yourself with the details of CIL code, you
are absolutely able to gain mastery of C# and the .NET base class libraries. In many ways, knowledge of
CIL is analogous to a C(++) programmer’s understanding of assembly language. Those who know the ins
and outs of the low-level “goo” are able to create rather advanced solutions for the task at hand and gain
a deeper understanding of the underlying programming (and runtime) environment. So, if you are up
for the challenge, let’s begin to examine the details of CIL.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Understand that this chapter is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the syntax and semantics
of CIL. If you require a full examination of the topic, I'd recommend downloading the official ECMA specification
(ecma-335.pdf) from the ECMA International web site (http://www.ecma-international.org).</p>
