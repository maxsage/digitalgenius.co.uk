<h1>Major Categories of ASP.NET Web Controls</h1>
    <p>The ASP.NET web control library can be broken down into several broad categories, all of which can be
viewed within the Visual Studio 2010 Toolbox (provided you have an *.aspx page open for design!). See
Figure 33-3.</p>

<p><b>Figure 33-3</b> The categories of ASP.NET web controls</p>
<p>Under the Standard area of the Toolbox, you will find the most frequently used controls, including
Button, Label, TextBox and ListBox. In addition to these vanilla-flavored UI elements, the Standard area
also lists more exotic web controls such as Calendar, Wizard, and AdRotator (Figure 33-4).</p>

<p>The Data section is where you can find a set of controls used for data binding operations, including
the new ASP.NET Chart control, which allows you to render out graphical chart data (pie charts, line
charts) typically as the result of a data binding operation (see Figure 33-5).</p>

<p>The ASP.NET validation controls (found in the Validation area of the toolbox) are very interesting in
that they can be configured to emit back blocks of client side JavaScript that will test input fields for valid
data. If a validation error occurs, the user will see an error message and will not be allowed to post back
to the web server until the error is corrected.</p>
<p>The Navigation node of the Toolbox is where you will find a small set of controls (Menu, SiteMapPath and
TreeView) which typically work in conjunction with a *.sitemap file. As briefly mentioned earlier in this chapter,
these navigation controls allow you to describe the structure of a multi-paged site using XML descriptions.</p>
<p>The really exotic set of ASP.NET web controls would have to be the Login controls (Figure 33-6).</p>

    <p><b>Figure 33-6</b> Security ASP.NET web controls</p>
<p>These controls can radically simplify how to incorporate basic security features (password recovery,
login screens, etc.) into your web applications. In fact, these controls are so powerful, they will even
dynamically create a dedicated database to store credentials (saved under the App_Data folder of your
website) if you do not already have a specific security database.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The remaining categories of web controls shown in the Visual Studio toolbox (such as WebParts, AJAX
Extensions and Dynamic Data) are for more specialized programming needs and will not be examined here.</p>
<h2>A Brief Word Regarding System.Web.UI.HtmlControls</h2>
<p>Truth be told, there are two distinct web control toolkits that ship with ASP.NET. In addition to the
ASP.NET web controls (within the System.Web.UI.WebControls namespace), the base class libraries also
provides the System.Web.UI.HtmlControls control library.</p>
<p>The HTML controls are a collection of types that allow you to make use of traditional HTML controls
on a web forms page. However, unlike simple HTML tags, HTML controls are object-oriented entities
that can be configured to run on the server and thus support server-side event handling. Unlike ASP.NET
web controls, HTML controls are quite simplistic in nature and offer little functionality beyond standard
HTML tags (HtmlButton, HtmlInputControl, HtmlTable, etc.).</p>
<p>The HTML controls can be useful if your team has a clear division between those who build HTML
UIs and .NET developers. HTML folks can make use of their web editor of choice using familiar markup
tags and pass the HTML files to the development team. At this point, developers can configure these
HTML controls to run as server controls (by right-clicking an HTML widget within Visual Studio 2010).
This will allow developers to handle server-side events and work with the HTML widget
programmatically.</p>
<p>The HTML controls provide a public interface that mimics standard HTML attributes. For example,
to obtain the information within an input area, you make use of the Value property rather than the web
control–centric Text property. Given that the HTML controls are not as feature-rich as the ASP.NET web
controls, I won’t make further mention of them in this text.</p>
<h2>Web Control Documentation</h2>
<p>You will get a chance to work with a number of ASP.NET web controls during the remainder of this book;
however, you should certainly take a moment to search the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for
the System.Web.UI.WebControls Namespace. Here you will find explanations and code examples for each
member of the namespace (Figure 33-7).</p>
