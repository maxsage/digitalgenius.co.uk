    <h1>Defining the Pillars of OOP</h1>
    <p>All object-based languages (C#, Java, C++, Smalltalk, Visual Basic, etc.) must contend
        with three core principals, often called the pillars of object-oriented programming
        (OOP):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Encapsulation:</i> How does this language hide an object's internal implementation
            details and preserve data integrity?</li>
        <li><i>Inheritance:</i>How does this language promote code reuse? </li>
        <li><i>Polymorphism:</i>How does this language let you treat related objects in a similar
            way? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before digging into the syntactic details of each pillar, it is important that you
        understand the basic role of each. Here is an overview of each pillar, which will
        be examined in full detail over the remainder of this chapter and the next.</p>
    <h2>The Role of Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>The first pillar of OOP is called encapsulation. This trait boils down to the language's
        ability to hide unnecessary implementation details from the object user. For example,
        assume you are using a class named DatabaseReader, which has two primary methods
        named Open() and Close():</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Assume this class encapsulates the details of opening and closing a database.</span>
DatabaseReader dbReader = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DatabaseReader();
dbReader.Open(<span
            class="str">@"C:\AutoLot.mdf"</span>);

<span class="rem">// Do something with data file and close the file.</span>
dbReader.Close();</pre>
    <p>The fictitious DatabaseReader class encapsulates the inner details of locating, loading,
        manipulating, and closing the data file. Programmers love encapsulation, as this
        pillar of OOP keeps coding tasks simpler. There is no need to worry about the numerous
        lines of code that are working behind the scenes to carry out the work of the DatabaseReader
        class. All you do is create an instance and send the appropriate messages (e.g.,
        "Open the file named AutoLot.mdf located on my C drive").</p>
    <p>Closely related to the notion of encapsulating programming logic is the idea of data
        protection. Ideally, an object's state data should be specified using the private
        (or possibly protected) keyword. In this way, the outside world must ask politely
        in order to change or obtain the underlying value. This is a good thing, as publicly
        declared data points can easily become corrupted (hopefully by accident rather than
        intent!). You will formally examine this aspect of encapsulation in just a bit.</p>
    <h2>The Role of Inheritance</h2>
    <p>The next pillar of OOP, inheritance, boils down to the language's ability to allow
        you to build new class definitions based on existing class definitions. In essence,
        inheritance allows you to extend the behavior of a base (or parent) class by inheriting
        core functionality into the derived subclass (also called a child class). Figure
        5-4 shows a simple example.</p>
    <p>You can read the diagram in Figure 5-4 as "A Hexagon is-a Shape that is-an Object."
        When you have classes related by this form of inheritance, you establish "is-a"
        relationships between types. The "is-a" relationship is termed inheritance.</p>
    <p>Here, you can assume that Shape defines some number of members that are common to
        all descendents (maybe a value to represent the color to draw the shape, and other
        values to represent the height and width). Given that the Hexagon class extends
        Shape, it inherits the core functionality defined by Shape and Object, as well as
        defines additional hexagon-related details of its own (whatever those may be).</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> Under the .NET platform, System.Object is always the topmost parent in
        any class hierarchy, which defines some general functionality for all types, fully
        described in Chapter 6.</p>
    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure05_04.png" alt="Figure 5-4" />
    <p><b>Figure 5-4.</b> The "is-a" relationship</p>
    <p>There is another form of code reuse in the world of OOP: the containment/delegation
        model also known as the "has-a" relationship or aggregation. This form of reuse
        is not used to establish parent/child relationships. Rather, the "has-a" relationship
        allows one class to define a member variable of another class and expose its functionality
        (if required) to the object user indirectly.</p>
    <p>For example, assume you are again modeling an automobile. You might want to express
        the idea that a car "has-a" radio. It would be illogical to attempt to derive the
        Car class from a Radio, or vice versa (a Car "is-a" Radio? I think not!). Rather,
        you have two independent classes working together, where the Car class creates and
        exposes the Radio's functionality:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Radio
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span
        class="kwrd">void</span> Power(<span class="kwrd">bool</span> turnOn)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span
            class="str">"Radio on: {0}"</span>, turnOn);
    }
}

<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{
    <span
                class="rem">// Car "has-a" Radio.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Radio myRadio = <span
                    class="kwrd">new</span> Radio();
        
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span
                        class="kwrd">void</span> TurnOnRadio(<span class="kwrd">bool</span> onOff)
    {
        <span
                            class="rem">// Delegate call to inner object.</span>
        myRadio.Power(onOff);
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that the object user has no clue that the Car class is making use of an inner
        Radio object.</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span
        class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Call is forwarded to Radio
            internally.</span>
    Car viper = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car();
    viper.TurnOnRadio(<span
                class="kwrd">false</span>);
}</pre>
    <h2>The Role of Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>The final pillar of OOP is <i>polymorphism</i>. This trait captures a language's
        ability to treat related objects in a similar manner. Specifically, this tenant
        of an object-oriented language allows a base class to define a set of members (formally
        termed the polymorphic interface) that are available to all descendents. A class's
        polymorphic interface is constructed using any number of virtual or abstract members.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, a "virtual member" is a member in a base class that defines a default
        implementation that may be changed (or more formally speaking, "overridden" by a
        derived class. In contrast, an "abstract method" is a member in a base class that
        does not provide a default implementation, but does provide a signature. When a
        class derives from a base class defining an abstract method, it "must" be overridden
        by a derived type. In either case, when derived types override the members defined
        by a base class, they are essentially redefining how they respond to the same request.</p>
    <p>To preview polymorphism, let's provide some details behind the shapes hierarchy shown
        in Figure 5-5. Assume that the Shape class has defined a virtual method named Draw()
        that takes no parameters. Given the fact that every shape needs to render itself
        in a unique manner, subclasses such as Hexagon and Circle are free to override this
        method to their own liking (see Figure 5-5).</p>
    <img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure05_05.png" alt="Figure 5-5" />
    <p><b>Figure 5-5.</b> Classical polymorphism</p>
	<p>Once a polymorphic interface has been designed, you can begin to make various assumptions
        in your code. For example, given that Hexagon and Circle derive from a common parent
        (Shape), an array of Shape types could contain anything deriving from this base
        class. Furthermore, given that Shape defines a polymorphic interface to all derived
        types (the Draw() method in this example), you can assume each member in the array
        has this functionality.</p>
    <p>Consider the following Main() method, which instructs an array of Shape-derived types
        to render themselves using the Draw() method:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
    <pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span
        class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Shape[] myShapes = <span
            class="kwrd">new</span> Shape[3];
        myShapes[0] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon();
        myShapes[1] = <span
                class="kwrd">new</span> Circle();
        myShapes[2] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Hexagon();
        <span
                    class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Shape s <span class="kwrd">in</span> myShapes)
        {
            <span
                        class="rem">// Use the polymorphic interface!</span>
            s.Draw();
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
	<p>This wraps up our brisk overview of the pillars of OOP. Now that you have the theory in your mind,
		the remainder of this chapter explores further details of how encapsulation is handled under C#.
		Chapter 6 will tackle the details of inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
