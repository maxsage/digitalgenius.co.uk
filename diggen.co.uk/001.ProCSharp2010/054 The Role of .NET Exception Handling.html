<h1>The Role of .NET Exception Handling</h1>
 <p>Prior to .NET, error handling under the Windows operating system was a confused mishmash of
techniques. Many programmers rolled their own error-handling logic within the context of a given
application. For example, a development team could define a set of numerical constants that
represented known error conditions, and make use of them as method return values. By way of an
example, consider the following partial C code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">/* A very C-style error trapping mechanism. */</span>
<span class="preproc">#define</span> E_FILENOTFOUND 1000

<span class="kwrd">int</span> SomeFunction()
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume something happens in this function</span>
    <span class="rem">// that causes the following return value.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> E_FILENOTFOUND;
}

<span class="kwrd">void</span> main()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> retVal = SomeFunction();
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(retVal == E_FILENOTFOUND)
    printf(<span class="str">"Cannot find file..."</span>);
}</pre>
<p>This approach is less than ideal, given the fact that the constant E_FILENOTFOUND is little more than a
numerical value, and is far from being a helpful agent regarding how to deal with the problem. Ideally,
you would like to wrap the error’s name, a descriptive message, and other helpful information about this
error condition into a single, well-defined package (which is exactly what happens under structured
exception handling).</p>
<p>In addition to a developer’s ad hoc techniques, the Windows API defines hundreds of error codes
that come by way of #defines, HRESULTs, and far too many variations on the simple Boolean (bool, BOOL,
VARIANT_BOOL, and so on). Furthermore, many C++ COM developers (and indirectly, many VB6 COM
developers) made use of a small set of standard COM interfaces (e.g., ISupportErrorInfo, IErrorInfo,
ICreateErrorInfo) to return meaningful error information to a COM client.</p>
<p>The obvious problem with these older techniques is the tremendous lack of symmetry. Each
approach is more or less tailored to a given technology, a given language, and perhaps even a given
project. To put an end to this madness, the .NET platform provides a standard technique to send and
trap runtime errors: structured exception handling (SEH).</p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that developers now have a unified approach to error handling,
which is common to all languages targeting the .NET platform. Therefore, the way in which a C#
programmer handles errors is syntactically similar to that of a VB programmer, or a C++ programmer
using C++/CLI.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, the syntax used to throw and catch exceptions across assemblies and machine
boundaries is identical. For example, if you use C# to build a Windows Communication Foundation
(WCF) service, you can throw a SOAP fault to a remote caller, using the same keywords that allow you to
throw an exception between methods in the same application.</p>
<p>Another bonus of .NET exceptions is that rather than receiving a cryptic numerical value that simply
identifies the problem at hand, exceptions are objects that contain a human-readable description of the
problem, as well as a detailed snapshot of the call stack that triggered the exception in the first place.
Furthermore, you are able to give the end user help-link information that points the user to a URL that
provides details about the error, as well as custom programmer-defined data.</p>
      <h2>The Atoms of .NET Exception Handling</h2>
 <p>Programming with structured exception handling involves the use of four interrelated entities:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A class type that represents the details of the exception.
  </li>
  <li>
    A member that throws an instance of the exception class to the caller under the correct circumstances
  </li>
  <li>
   A block of code on the caller’s side that invokes the exception-prone member
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>A block of code on the caller’s side that will process (or catch) the exception should it occur</p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>The C# programming language offers four keywords (try, catch, throw, and finally) that allow you
to throw and handle exceptions. The object that represents the problem at hand is a class extending
System.Exception (or a descendent thereof). Given this fact, let’s check out the role of this exceptioncentric
base class.</p>
<h2>The System.Exception Base Class</h2>
 <p>All user- and system-defined exceptions ultimately derive from the System.Exception base class, which
in turn derives from System.Object. Here is the crux of this class (note that some of these members are
virtual and may thus be overridden by derived classes):</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Exception : ISerializable, _Exception
{
    <span class="rem">// Public constructors</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Exception(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message, Exception innerException);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Exception(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Exception();
...

    <span class="rem">// Methods</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> Exception GetBaseException();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info,
        StreamingContext context);

    <span class="rem">// Properties</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> IDictionary Data { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> HelpLink { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Exception InnerException { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Message { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Source { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> StackTrace { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MethodBase TargetSite { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
...
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, many of the properties defined by System.Exception are read-only in nature. This is
due to the fact that derived types will typically supply default values for each property. For example, the
default message of the IndexOutOfRangeException type is “Index was outside the bounds of the array.”</p>
<p><b>Note </b>The Exception class implements two .NET interfaces. Although we have yet to examine interfaces (see
Chapter 9), just understand that the _Exception interface allows a .NET exception to be processed by an
unmanaged code base (such as a COM application), while the ISerializable interface allows an exception
object to be persisted across boundaries (such as a machine boundary).</p>
<p>Table 7-1 describes the most important members of System.Exception.</p>

     This read-only property retrieves a collection of key/value pairs
(represented by an object implementing IDictionary) that provide
additional, programmer-defined information about the exception. By
default, this collection is empty.

     This read-only property can be used to obtain information about the
previous exception(s) that caused the current exception to occur. The
previous exception(s) are recorded by passing them into the constructor
of the most current exception.

The error message itself is set as a constructor parameter.

     StackTrace

     This read-only property contains a string that identifies the sequence of
     calls that triggered the exception. As you might guess, this property is
     very useful during debugging or if you wish to dump the error to an
     external error log.

   <td>
    TargetSite

   <td>
    This read-only property returns a MethodBase object, which describes
numerous details about the method that threw the exception (invoking
ToString() will identify the method by name).
