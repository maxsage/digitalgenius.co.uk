<h1>Watching Files Programmatically</h1>
<p>Now that you have a better handle on the use of various readers and writers, you’ll look at the role of the
FileSystemWatcher class. This type can be quite helpful when you wish to monitor (or “watch”) files on
your system programmatically. Specifically, you can instruct the FileSystemWatcher type to monitor files
for any of the actions specified by the System.IO.NotifyFilters enumeration (many of these members
are self-explanatory, but you should still check the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for more
details):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> NotifyFilters
{
    Attributes, CreationTime,
    DirectoryName, FileName,
    LastAccess, LastWrite,
    Security, Size
}</pre>
<p>To begin working with the FileSystemWatcher type, you need to set the Path property to specify the
name (and location) of the directory that contains the files you want to monitor, as well as the Filter
property that defines the file extensions of the files you want to monitor.</p>
<p>At this point, you may choose to handle the Changed, Created, and Deleted events, all of which work
in conjunction with the FileSystemEventHandler delegate. This delegate can call any method matching
the following pattern:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The FileSystemEventHandler delegate must point</span>
<span class="rem">// to methods matching the following signature.</span>
<span class="kwrd">void</span> MyNotificationHandler(<span class="kwrd">object</span> source, FileSystemEventArgs e)</pre>
<p>You can also handle the Renamed event using the RenamedEventHandler delegate type, which can call
methods that match the following signature:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The RenamedEventHandler delegate must point</span>
<span class="rem">// to methods matching the following signature.</span>
<span class="kwrd">void</span> MyRenamedHandler(<span class="kwrd">object</span> source, RenamedEventArgs e)</pre>
<p>Next, let’s look at the process of watching a file. Assume you have created a new directory on your C:
drive named MyFolder that contains various *.txt files (named whatever you wish). The following
Console Application (named MyDirectoryWatcher) monitors the *.txt files in the MyFolder directory and
prints out messages when files are created, deleted, modified, or renamed:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** The Amazing File Watcher App *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Establish the path to the directory to watch.</span>
    FileSystemWatcher watcher = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileSystemWatcher();
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        watcher.Path = <span class="str">@"C:\MyFolder"</span>;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(ArgumentException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span>;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Set up the things to be on the lookout for.</span>
    watcher.NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.LastAccess
        | NotifyFilters.LastWrite
        | NotifyFilters.FileName
        | NotifyFilters.DirectoryName;
        
    <span class="rem">// Only watch text files.</span>
    watcher.Filter = <span class="str">"*.txt"</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Add event handlers.</span>
    watcher.Changed += <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileSystemEventHandler(OnChanged);
    watcher.Created += <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileSystemEventHandler(OnChanged);
    watcher.Deleted += <span class="kwrd">new</span> FileSystemEventHandler(OnChanged);
    watcher.Renamed += <span class="kwrd">new</span> RenamedEventHandler(OnRenamed);

    <span class="rem">// Begin watching the directory.</span>
    watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    
    <span class="rem">// Wait for the user to quit the program.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">@"Press 'q' to quit app."</span>);
    while(Console.Read()!=<span class="str">'q'</span>);
}</pre>
<p>The two event handlers simply print out the current file modification:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnChanged(<span class="kwrd">object</span> source, FileSystemEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Specify what is done when a file is changed, created, or deleted.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"File: {0} {1}!"</span>, e.FullPath, e.ChangeType);
}

<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnRenamed(<span class="kwrd">object</span> source, RenamedEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Specify what is done when a file is renamed.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"File: {0} renamed to\n{1}"</span>, e.OldFullPath, e.FullPath);
}</pre>
<p>To test this program, run the application and open Windows Explorer. Try renaming your files,
creating a *.txt file, deleting a *.txt file, and so forth. You will see various bits of information generated
about the state of the text files within your MyFolder, as in this example:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** The Amazing File Watcher App *****

Press 'q' to quit app.
File: C:\MyFolder\New Text Document.txt Created!
File: C:\MyFolder\New Text Document.txt renamed to
C:\MyFolder\Hello.txt
File: C:\MyFolder\Hello.txt Changed!
File: C:\MyFolder\Hello.txt Changed!
File: C:\MyFolder\Hello.txt Deleted!</pre>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> You can find the MyDirectoryWatcher application under the Chapter 20 subdirectory.</p>
<p>That wraps up this chapter’s look at fundamental IO operations within the .NET platform. While you
will certainly use these techniques in many of your applications, you might also find that object
serialization services can greatly simplify how you persist large amounts of data.</p>
