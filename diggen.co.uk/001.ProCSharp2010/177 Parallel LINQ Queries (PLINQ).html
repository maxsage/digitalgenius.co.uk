<h1>Parallel LINQ Queries (PLINQ)</h1>
<p>To wrap up your look at the TPL, be aware that there is another way you can incorporate parallel tasks
into your .NET applications. If you wish, you can make use of a new set of extension methods, which
allow you to construct a LINQ query that will perform its workload in parallel (if possible). Fittingly,
LINQ queries that are designed to run in parallel are termed PLINQ queries.</p>
<p>Like parallel code authored using the Parallel class, PLINQ has the option of ignoring your request
to process the collection in parallel if need be. The PLINQ framework has been optimized in numerous
ways, which includes determining if a query would in fact perform faster in a synchronous manner.</p>
<p>At run time, PLINQ analyzes the overall structure of the query and if the query is likely to benefit
from parallelization, it will run concurrently. However, if parallelizing a query would hurt performance
PLINQ just runs the query sequentially. If PLINQ has a choice between a potentially expensive parallel
algorithm or an inexpensive sequential algorithm, it chooses the sequential algorithm by default.</p>
<p>The necessary extension methods are found within the ParallelEnumerable class of the System.Linq
namespace. Table 19-5 documents some useful PLINQ extensions.</p>
<p><b>Table 19-4.</b> Select members of the ParallelEnumerable class</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Member
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AsParallel()
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies that the rest of the query should be parallelized, if possible.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    WithCancellation()
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies that PLINQ should periodically monitor the state of the
provided cancellation token and cancel execution if it is requested.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    WithDegreeOfParallelism()
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies the maximum number of processors that PLINQ should use to
parallelize the query.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ForAll()
   </td>
   <td>
    Enables results to be processed in parallel without first merging back to
the consumer thread, as would be the case when enumerating a LINQ
result using the foreach keyword.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To see PLINQ in action, create a final Windows Forms application named
PLINQDataProcessingWithCancellation and import the System.Threading and System.Threading.Tasks
namespaces. This simple form will only need two Button controls named btnExecute and btnCancel.
Then the “Execute” button is clicked, you will fire off a new Task which executes a LINQ query that
investigates a very large array of integers, looking for only the items x % 3 == 0 is true. Here is a nonparallel
version of the query:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnExecute_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Start a new "task" to process the ints.</span>
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt;
        {
            ProcessIntData();
        });
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessIntData()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Get a very large array of integers.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] source = Enumerable.Range(1, 10000000).ToArray();

        <span class="rem">// Find the numbers where num % 3 == 0 is true, returned</span>
        <span class="rem">// in descending order.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] modThreeIsZero = (<span class="kwrd">from</span> num <span class="kwrd">in</span> source where num % 3 == 0
            orderby num descending select num).ToArray();
    
        MessageBox.Show(<span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Found {0} numbers that match query!"</span>,
            modThreeIsZero.Count()));
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Opting in to a PLINQ Query</h2>
<p>If you wish to inform the TPL to execute this query in parallel (if possible), you will want to make use of
the AsParallel() extension method as so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">int</span>[] modThreeIsZero = (<span class="kwrd">from</span> num <span class="kwrd">in</span> source.AsParallel() where num % 3 == 0
    orderby num descending select num).ToArray();</pre>
 <p>Notice how the overall format of the LINQ query is identical to what you have seen in previous
chapters. However, by including a call to AsParallel(), the TPL will attempt to pass the workload off to
an available CPU.</p>
<h2>Canceling a PLINQ Query</h2>
<p>It is also possible to use a CancellationTokenSource object to inform a PLINQ query to stop processing
under the correct conditions (typically due to user intervention). Declare a form level
CancellationTokenSource object named cancelToken and implement the Click handler of the btnCancel
to call the Cancel() method on this object. Here is the relevant code update:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainForm : Form
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> CancellationTokenSource cancelToken = <span class="kwrd">new</span> CancellationTokenSource();
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnCancel_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        cancelToken.Cancel();
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>Now, inform the PLINQ query that it should be on the lookout for an incoming cancellation request
by chaining on the WithCancellation() extension method, and passing in the token. In addition, you will
want to wrap this PLINQ query in a proper try/catch scope, and deal with the possible exception. Here is
the final version of the ProcessIntData() method.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ProcessIntData()
{
    <span class="rem">// Get a very large array of integers.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] source = Enumerable.Range(1, 10000000).ToArray();

    <span class="rem">// Find the numbers where num % 3 == 0 is true, returned</span>
    <span class="rem">// in descending order.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] modThreeIsZero = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        modThreeIsZero = (<span class="kwrd">from</span> num <span class="kwrd">in</span>
            source.AsParallel().WithCancellation(cancelToken.Token)
            where num % 3 == 0 orderby num descending
            select num).ToArray();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (OperationCanceledException ex)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Text = ex.Message;
    }

    MessageBox.Show(<span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"Found {0} numbers that match query!"</span>,
        modThreeIsZero.Count()));
}</pre>
    <p>That wraps up the introductory look at the Task Parallel Library and PLINQ. As mentioned, these
new .NET 4.0 APIs are quickly becoming the preferred manner to work with multithreaded applications.
However, effective use of TPL and PLINQ demand a solid understanding of multithreaded concepts and
primitives, which you have been exposed to over the course of this chapter.</p>
<p>If you find these topics interesting, be sure to look up the topic “Parallel Programming in the .NET
Framework” in the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation. Here you will find a good number of
sample projects which will extend what you have seen here.</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The PLINQDataProcessingWithCancellation project is included under the Chapter 19 subdirectory.</p>
