<h1>Understanding .NET Application Domains</h1>
<p>Under the .NET platform, executables are not hosted directly within a Windows process, as is the case in
traditional unmanaged applications. Rather, a .NET executable is hosted by a logical partition within a
process termed an application domain. As you will see, a single process may contain multiple
application domains, each of which is hosting a .NET executable. This additional subdivision of a
traditional Windows process offers several benefits, some of which are as follows:</p>    
<ul>
 <li>AppDomains are a key aspect of the OS-neutral nature of the .NET platform, given
that this logical division abstracts away the differences in how an underlying OS
represents a loaded executable.</li>
 <li>AppDomains are far less expensive in terms of processing power and memory
than a full-blown process. Thus, the CLR is able to load and unload application
domains much quicker than a formal process, and can drastically improve
scalability of server applications.</li>
 <li>AppDomains provide a deeper level of isolation for hosting a loaded application. If
one AppDomain within a process fails, the remaining AppDomains remain
functional.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, a single process can host any number of AppDomains, each of which is fully and
completely isolated from other AppDomains within this process (or any other process). Given this fact,
be very aware that an application running in one AppDomain is unable to obtain data of any kind (global
variables or static fields) within another AppDomain unless they make use of a distributed programming
protocol (such as Windows Communication Foundation).</p>
<p>While a single process may host multiple AppDomains, this is not typically the case. At the very
least, an OS process will host what is termed the default application domain. This specific application
domain is automatically created by the CLR at the time the process launches. After this point, the CLR
creates additional application domains on an as-needed basis.</p>
<h2>The System.AppDomain Class</h2>
<p>The .NET platform allows you to programmatically monitor app domains, create new app domains (or
unload them) at runtime, load assemblies into app domains, and a whole slew of additional tasks, using
the AppDomain class in the System namespace of mscorlib.dll. Table 16-5 documents some useful
methods of the AppDomain class (consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details).</p>

  <tr>
   <td>
    CreateDomain()
   </td>
   <td>
    This static method allows you to create a new AppDomain in the current
process.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    CreateInstance()
   </td>
   <td>
    Creates an instance of a type in an external assembly, after loading said
assembly into the calling application domain.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ExecuteAssembly()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method executes an *.exe assembly within an application domain,
given its file name.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    GetAssemblies()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method gets the set of .NET assemblies that have been loaded into
this application domain (COM-based or C-based binaries are ignored).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    GetCurrentThreadId()
   </td>
   <td>
    This static method returns the ID of the active thread in the current
application domain.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Load()
   </td>
   <td>
    This method is used to dynamically load an assembly into the current
application domain.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Unload()
   </td>
   <td>
    This is another static method that allows you to unload a specified
AppDomain within a given process.
   </td>
  </tr>
 </table>
<p><b>Note</b> The .NET platform does not allow you to unload a specific assembly from memory. The only way to
programmatically unload libraries is to tear down the hosting application domain via the Unload() method.</p>
<p>In addition, the AppDomain class also defines a set of properties which can be useful when you wish
to monitor activity of a given application domain. Table 16-6 documents some core properties of
interest.</p>

assemblies.

    Gets the friendly name of the current application domain.

   <td>
    MonitoringIsEnabled
   </td>
   <td>
    Gets or sets a value that indicates whether CPU and memory monitoring
of application domains is enabled for the current process. Once
monitoring is enabled for a process, it cannot be disabled.
   </td>

   <td>

   </td>
   <td>
    Gets the configuration details for a given application domain,
represented by an AppDomainSetup object.

<p>Last but not least, the AppDomain class supports a set of events that correspond to various aspects of
an application domain’s life cycle. Table 16-7 shows some of the more useful events you can hook into.</p>
