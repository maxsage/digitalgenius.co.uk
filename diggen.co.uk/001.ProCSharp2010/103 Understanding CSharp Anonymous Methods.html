<h1>Understanding C# Anonymous Methods</h1>
  <p>As you have seen, when a caller wishes to listen to incoming events, it must define a custom method in a
class (or structure) that matches the signature of the associated delegate, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {    
        SomeType t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SomeType();

        <span class="rem">// Assume "SomeDelegate" can point to methods taking no</span>
        <span class="rem">// args and returning void.</span>
        t.SomeEvent += <span class="kwrd">new</span> SomeDelegate(MyEventHandler);
    }

    <span class="rem">// Typically only called by the SomeDelegate object.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MyEventHandler()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Do something when event is fired.</span>
    }
}</pre>
<p>When you think about it, however, methods such as MyEventHandler() are seldom intended to be
called by any part of the program other than the invoking delegate. As far as productivity is concerned, it
is a bit of a bother (though in no way a showstopper) to manually define a separate method to be called
by the delegate object.</p>
<p>To address this point, it is possible to associate an event directly to a block of code statements at the
time of event registration. Formally, such code is termed an anonymous method. To illustrate the syntax,
check out the following Main() method, which handles the events sent from the Car class using
anonymous methods, rather than specifically named event handlers:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Anonymous Methods *****\n"</span>);
        Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"SlugBug"</span>, 100, 10);

        <span class="rem">// Register event handlers as anonymous methods.</span>
        c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Eek! Going too fast!"</span>);
        };

        c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Message from Car: {0}"</span>, e.msg);
        };

        c1.Exploded += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Fatal Message from Car: {0}"</span>, e.msg);
        };

        <span class="rem">// This will eventually trigger the events.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; 6; i++)
            c1.Accelerate(20);
    
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p><b>Note </b>The final curly bracket of an anonymous method must be terminated by a semicolon. If you fail to do so,
you are issued a compilation error.</p>
<p>Again, notice that the Program type no longer defines specific static event handlers such as
CarAboutToBlow() or CarExploded(). Rather, the unnamed (aka anonymous) methods are defined inline
at the time the caller is handling the event using the += syntax. The basic syntax of an anonymous
method matches the following pseudo-code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        SomeType t = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SomeType();
        t.SomeEvent += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> (optionallySpecifiedDelegateArgs)
        { <span class="rem">/* statements */</span> };
    }
}</pre>
<p>When handling the first AboutToBlow event within the previous Main() method, notice that you are
not specifying the arguments passed from the delegate:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Eek! Going too fast!"</span>);
};</pre>
<p>Strictly speaking, you are not required to receive the incoming arguments sent by a specific event.
However, if you wish to make use of the possible incoming arguments, you will need to specify the
parameters prototyped by the delegate type (as shown in the second handling of the AboutToBlow and
Exploded events). For example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Critical Message from Car: {0}"</span>, e.msg);
};</pre>
<h2>Accessing Local Variables</h2>
  <p>Anonymous methods are interesting in that they are able to access the local variables of the method that
defines them. Formally speaking, such variables are termed outer variables of the anonymous method. A
few important points about the interaction between an anonymous method scope and the scope of the
defining method should be mentioned:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  An anonymous method cannot access ref or out parameters of the defining method
 </li>
 <li>
  An anonymous method cannot have a local variable with the same name as a local variable
in the outer method
 </li>
 <li>
  An anonymous method can access instance variables (or static variables, as appropriate) in
the outer class scope
 </li>
 <li>
  An anonymous method can declare local variables with the same name as outer class
member variables (the local variables have a distinct scope and hide the outer class member
variables)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Assume our Main() method defined a local integer named aboutToBlowCounter. Within the
anonymous methods that handle the AboutToBlow event, we will increment this counter by 1 and print
out the tally before Main() completes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Anonymous Methods *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> aboutToBlowCounter = 0;

    <span class="rem">// Make a car as usual.</span>
    Car c1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"SlugBug"</span>, 100, 10);

    <span class="rem">// Register event handlers as anonymous methods.</span>
    c1.AboutToBlow += <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>
    {
        aboutToBlowCounter++;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Eek! Going too fast!"</span>);
    };

    c1.AboutToBlow += (<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, CarEventArgs e)
    {
        aboutToBlowCounter++;
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Critical Message from Car: {0}"</span>, e.msg);
    };
...
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"AboutToBlow event was fired {0} times."</span>,
        aboutToBlowCounter);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Once you run this updated Main() method, you will find the final Console.WriteLine() reports the
AboutToBlow event was fired twice.</p>
