<h1>A Brief Word Regarding Corrupted State Exceptions (CSE)</h1>
  <p>To wrap up our examination of C#’s structured exception handling support, allow me to mention a
brand-new .NET 4.0 namespace called System.Runtime.ExceptionServices (which is a member of the
mscorlib.dll assembly). This namespace is quite small, defining only two class types that can be used if
you wish to equip various methods within your application (such as the Main() method) with the ability
to intercept and process “corrupted state exceptions,” otherwise known as CSEs.</p>
<p>As you learned back in Chapter 1, the .NET platform sits on top of the hosting operating system
(such as Microsoft Windows). Now, based on your background in Windows programming, you may
recall that the low-level Windows API has a very unique set of rules regarding the treatment of runtime
errors, which look little like .NET’s structured exception handling techniques.</p>
<p>Within the Windows API, it is possible to trap extremely low-level errors that represent “corrupted
state” errors. Simply put, if the Windows OS sends out a corrupted state error, your program is in very
bad shape. So much so, that there is no hope of recovery and the only corrective course of action is to
terminate the program.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> As a .NET programmer, the only times you may accidentally trigger a CSE error is if your C# code is using
platform invocation services (to talk directly to the Windows API) or using C# pointer syntax</p>
<p>Before the release of .NET 4.0, the CLR would allow these very low-level, OS-specific errors to be
trapped using a general System.Exception catch block. The problem, however, was that if a CSE
exception was somehow encountered and trapped within such a catch block, the .NET platform did not
(and still does not) provide much by way of elegant recovery code.</p>
<p>Now, with the release of .NET 4.0, the CLR will not allow CSEs to be automatically caught
within your .NET applications. Most of the time, this is exactly what you would want. However, if
you did still wish to receive notifications of these OS-level errors (which would typically be only if
you had some legacy code that required such notifications), you can make use of the
[HandledProcessCorruptedStateExceptions] attribute.</p>
<p>While we have not yet examined the role of .NET attributes (see Chapter 15), for now just
understand that this attribute can be applied on any method of your application, and when you do this,
the method in question will have a chance to deal with these low-level OS errors. By way of a simple
example, assuming you have imported the System.Runtime.ExceptionServices namespace into your C#
code file, you could build the following Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[HandledProcessCorruptedStateExceptions]
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Assume Main() is invoking a method which</span>
        <span class="rem">// runs the entire program.</span>
        RunMyApplication();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception ex)
    {
        <span class="rem">// If we get here, we know something really bad happended.</span>
        <span class="rem">// Just print out the message and exit the program...we are</span>
        <span class="rem">// doomed!</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Ack! Huge problem: {0}"</span>, ex.Message);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> -1;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> 0;
}</pre>
<p>Here we have a Main() method that does little more than call a second method that deals with the
entire running of the application. For this example, we will assume that RunMyApplication() makes
liberal use of try/catch logic to deal with any expected error. However, since Main() has been marked
with the [HandledProcessCorruptedStateExceptions] attribute, if a CSE error is encountered, the
catching of the System.Exception is our last chance to do something before the program is terminated.</p>
<p>Here, the Main() method returns an int, rather than void. As explained in Chapter 3, by convention,
returning zero to the OS indicates the application exits without error, while any other value (typically a
negative number) signifies an error.</p>
<p>This text will not deal with the processing of these low-level Windows OS errors, and therefore, I
won’t comment on the role of System.Runtime.ExceptionServices beyond this point. If you are in need
of further details, consult the .NET 4.0 Framework SDK documentation.</p>
