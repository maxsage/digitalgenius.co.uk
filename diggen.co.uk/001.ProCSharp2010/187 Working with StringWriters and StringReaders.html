<h1>Working with StringWriters and StringReaders</h1>
<p>You can use the StringWriter and StringReader types to treat textual information as a stream of inmemory
characters. This can prove helpful when you wish to append character-based information to an
underlying buffer. The following Console Application (named StringReaderWriterApp) illustrates this by
writing a block of string data to a StringWriter object, rather than to a file on the local hard drive:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with StringWriter / StringReader *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Create a StringWriter and emit character data to memory.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(StringWriter strWriter = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringWriter())
    {
        strWriter.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Don't forget Mother's Day this year..."</span>);
        
        <span class="rem">// Get a copy of the contents (stored in a string) and pump</span>
        <span class="rem">// to console.</span>

        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Contents of StringWriter:\n{0}"</span>, strWriter);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>StringWriter and StreamWriter both derive from the same base class (TextWriter), so the writing
logic is more or less identical. However, given the nature of StringWriter, you should also be aware that
this class allows you to use the GetStringBuilder() method to extract a System.Text.StringBuilder
object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (StringWriter strWriter = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringWriter())
{
    strWriter.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Don't forget Mother's Day this year..."</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Contents of StringWriter:\n{0}"</span>, strWriter);
    
    <span class="rem">// Get the internal StringBuilder.</span>
    StringBuilder sb = strWriter.GetStringBuilder();
    sb.Insert(0, <span class="str">"Hey!! "</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; {0}"</span>, sb.ToString());
    sb.Remove(0, <span class="str">"Hey!! "</span>.Length);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; {0}"</span>, sb.ToString());
}</pre>
<p>When you wish to read from a stream of character data, you can use the corresponding
StringReader type, which (as you would expect) functions identically to the related StreamReader class.
In fact, the StringReader class does nothing more than override the inherited members to read from a
block of character data, rather than from a file, as shown here:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> (StringWriter strWriter = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringWriter())
{
    strWriter.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Don't forget Mother's Day this year..."</span>);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Contents of StringWriter:\n{0}"</span>, strWriter);

    <span class="rem">// Read data from the StringWriter.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (StringReader strReader = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringReader(strWriter.ToString()))
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> input = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
        while ((input = strReader.ReadLine()) != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        {    
            Console.WriteLine(input);
        }
    }
}</pre>
