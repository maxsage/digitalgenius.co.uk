<h1>Interacting with Processes Under the .NET Platform</h1>
    <p>Although processes and threads are nothing new, the manner in which you interact with these -
primitives under the .NET platform has changed quite a bit (for the better). To pave the way to
understanding the world of building multithreaded assemblies (see Chapter 19), let’s begin by checking
out how to interact with processes using the .NET base class libraries.</p>
<p>The System.Diagnostics namespace defines a number of types that allow you to programmatically
interact with processes and various diagnostic-related types such as the system event log and
performance counters. In this chapter, you are only concerned with the process-centric types defined in
Table 16-1.</p>

<p>The System.Diagnostics.Process class allows you to analyze the processes running on a given
machine (local or remote). The Process class also provides members that allow you to programmatically
start and terminate processes, view (or modify) a process’s priority level, and obtain a list of active
threads and/or loaded modules within a given process. Table 16-2 lists some of the key properties of
System.Diagnostics.Process.</p>

<h2>Enumerating Running Processes</h2>
<p>To illustrate the process of manipulating Process objects (pardon the redundancy), assume you have a
C# Console Application named ProcessManipulator that defines the following static helper method
within the Program class (be sure you import the System.Diagnostics namespace in your code file):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ListAllRunningProcesses()
{
    <span class="rem">// Get all the processes on the local machine, ordered by</span>
    <span class="rem">// PID.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> runningProcs =
        <span class="kwrd">from</span> proc <span class="kwrd">in</span> Process.GetProcesses(<span class="str">"."</span>) orderby proc.Id select proc;

    <span class="rem">// Print out PID and name of each process.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(<span class="kwrd">var</span> p <span class="kwrd">in</span> runningProcs)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> info = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"-&gt; PID: {0}\tName: {1}"</span>,
            p.Id, p.ProcessName);
        Console.WriteLine(info);
    }
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"************************************\n"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>The static Process.GetProcesses() method returns an array of Process objects that represent the
running processes on the target machine (the dot notation shown here represents the local computer).
Once you have obtained the array of Process objects, you are able to invoke any of the members seen in
Table 16-2 and Table 16-3. Here, you are simply displaying the PID and the name of each process,
ordered by PID. Assuming the Main() method has been updated to call ListAllRunningProcesses():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Processes *****\n"</span>);
    ListAllRunningProcesses();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>you will see the names and PIDs for all processes on your local computer. Here is some partial
output from my current machine.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Processes *****

-&gt; PID: 0     Name: Idle
-&gt; PID: 4     Name: System

-&gt; PID: 1136     Name: ProcessManipulator.vshost
************************************</pre>
<h2>Investigating a Specific Process</h2>
<p>In addition to obtaining a full and complete list of all running processes on a given machine, the static
Process.GetProcessById() method allows you to obtain a single Process object via the associated PID. If
you request access to a nonexistent PID, an ArgumentException exception is thrown. For example, if you
were interested in obtaining a Process object representing a process with the PID of 987, you could write
the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// If there is no process with the PID of 987, a</span>
<span class="rem">// runtime exception will be thrown.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> GetSpecificProcess()
{
    Process theProc = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        theProc = Process.GetProcessById(987);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(ArgumentException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you have learned how to get a list of all processes, or a specific process on a machine
via a PID lookup. While it is somewhat useful to discover PIDs and process names, the Process class also
allows you to discover the set of current threads and libraries used within a given process. Let’s see how
to do so.</p>
<h2>Investigating a Process’s Thread Set</h2>
<p>The set of threads is represented by the strongly typed ProcessThreadCollection collection, which
contains some number of individual ProcessThread objects. To illustrate, assume the following
additional static helper function has been added to your current application:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> EnumThreadsForPid(<span class="kwrd">int</span> pID)
{
    Process theProc = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        theProc = Process.GetProcessById(pID);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(ArgumentException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span>;
    }

    <span class="rem">// List out stats for each thread in the specified process.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Here are the threads used by: {0}"</span>,
        theProc.ProcessName);
    ProcessThreadCollection theThreads = theProc.Threads;

    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(ProcessThread pt <span class="kwrd">in</span> theThreads)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> info =
            <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"-&gt; Thread ID: {0}\tStart Time: {1}\tPriority: {2}"</span>,
                pt.Id , pt.StartTime.ToShortTimeString(), pt.PriorityLevel);
        Console.WriteLine(info);
    }
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"************************************\n"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, the Threads property of the System.Diagnostics.Process type provides access to the
ProcessThreadCollection class. Here, you are printing out the assigned thread ID, start time, and priority
level of each thread in the process specified by the client. Now, update your program’s Main() method to
prompt the user for a PID to investigate, as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Prompt user for a PID and print out the set of active threads.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Enter PID of process to investigate *****"</span>);
    Console.Write(<span class="str">"PID: "</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> pID = Console.ReadLine();
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> theProcID = <span class="kwrd">int</span>.Parse(pID);
    
    EnumThreadsForPid(theProcID);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>When you run your program, you can now enter the PID of any process on your machine, and see
the threads used in the process. The following output shows the threads used by PID 108 on my
machine, which happens to be hosting Microsoft Internet Explorer:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Enter PID of process to investigate *****
PID: 108
Here are the threads used by: iexplore
-&gt; Thread ID: 680     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 2040     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal

-&gt; Thread ID: 3476     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 2264     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 2380     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 2384     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 2308     Start Time: 9:05 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 3096     Start Time: 9:07 AM     Priority: Highest
-&gt; Thread ID: 3600     Start Time: 9:45 AM     Priority: Normal
-&gt; Thread ID: 1412     Start Time: 10:02 AM     Priority: Normal</pre>

<p>Before you read any further, be very aware that the ProcessThread type is not the entity used to
create, suspend, or kill threads under the .NET platform. Rather, ProcessThread is a vehicle used to obtain
diagnostic information for the active Windows threads within a running process. Again, you will investigate
how to build multithreaded applications using the System.Threading namespace in Chapter 19.</p>
<h2>Investigating a Process’s Module Set</h2>
<p>Next up, let’s check out how to iterate over the number of loaded modules that are hosted within a given
process. When talking about processes, a module is a general term used to describe a given *.dll (or the
*.exe itself) that is hosted by a specific process. When you access the ProcessModuleCollection via the
Process.Modules property, you are able to enumerate over all modules hosted within a process: .NETbased,
COM-based, or traditional C-based libraries. Ponder the following additional helper function that
will enumerate the modules in a specific process based on the PID:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> EnumModsForPid(<span class="kwrd">int</span> pID)
{
    Process theProc = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        theProc = Process.GetProcessById(pID);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(ArgumentException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
        <span class="kwrd">return</span>;
    }

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Here are the loaded modules for: {0}"</span>,
        theProc.ProcessName);
    ProcessModuleCollection theMods = theProc.Modules;
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(ProcessModule pm <span class="kwrd">in</span> theMods)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">string</span> info = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"-&gt; Mod Name: {0}"</span>, pm.ModuleName);
        Console.WriteLine(info);
    }
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"************************************\n"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>To see some possible output, let’s check out the loaded modules for the process hosting the current
example program (ProcessManipulator). To do so, run the application, identify the PID assigned to
ProcessManipulator.exe (via the Task Manager) and pass this value to the EnumModsForPid() method (be
sure to update your Main() method accordingly). Once you do, you may be surprised to see the list of
*.dlls used for a simple Console Application (GDI32.dll, USER32.dll, ole32.dll, and so forth). Consider
the following output:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
Here are the loaded modules for: ProcessManipulator
-&gt; Mod Name: ProcessManipulator.exe
-&gt; Mod Name: ntdll.dll
-&gt; Mod Name: MSCOREE.DLL

-&gt; Mod Name: KERNELBASE.dll
-&gt; Mod Name: ADVAPI32.dll

************************************</pre>
<h2>Starting and Stopping Processes Programmatically</h2>
<p>The final aspects of the System.Diagnostics.Process class examined here are the Start() and Kill()
methods. As you can gather by their names, these members provide a way to programmatically launch and
terminate a process, respectively. For example, consider the static StartAndKillProcess() helper method:</p>
<p><b>Note</b> You must be running Visual Studio 2010 with Administrator rights in order to start new processes. If this is
not the case, you will receive a runtime error.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StartAndKillProcess()
{
    Process ieProc = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Launch Internet Explorer, and go to facebook!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        ieProc = Process.Start(<span class="str">"IExplore.exe"</span>, <span class="str">"www.facebook.com"</span>);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }

    Console.Write(<span class="str">"--&gt; Hit enter to kill {0}..."</span>, ieProc.ProcessName);
    Console.ReadLine();

    <span class="rem">// Kill the iexplore.exe process.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        ieProc.Kill();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}</pre>
<p>The static Process.Start() method has been overloaded a few times. At minimum, you will need to
specify the friendly name of the process you wish to launch (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer,
iexplore.exe). This example makes use of a variation of the Start() method that allows you to specify
any additional arguments to pass into the program’s entry point (i.e., the Main() method).</p>
<p>Once you call the Start() method, you are returned a reference to the newly activated process.
When you wish to terminate the process, simply call the instance-level Kill() method. Here, you are
wrapping the calls to Start() and Kill() within a try / catch block, and handling any
InvalidOperationException errors. This is especially important when calling the Kill() method, as this
error will be raised if the process has already been terminated prior to calling Kill().</p>
<h2>Controlling Process Startup using the ProcessStartInfo Class</h2>
<p>The Start() method also allows you to pass in a System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo type to specify
additional bits of information regarding how a given process should come to life. Here is a partial
definition of ProcessStartInfo (see the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->

<p>To illustrate how to fine-tune your process startup, here is a modified version of
StartAndKillProcess(), which will load Microsoft Internet Explorer, navigate to www.facebook.com, and
show the window in a maximized state:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StartAndKillProcess()
{
    Process ieProc = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Launch Internet Explorer, and go to facebook,</span>
    <span class="rem">// with maximized window.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        ProcessStartInfo startInfo = <span class="kwrd">new</span>
            ProcessStartInfo(<span class="str">"IExplore.exe"</span>, <span class="str">"www.facebook.com"</span>);
        startInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Maximized;

        ieProc = Process.Start(startInfo);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (InvalidOperationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>Great! Now that you understand the role of Windows processes and how to interact with them from
C# code, you are ready to investigate the concept of a .NET application domain.</p>
