<h1>Building Enumerable Types (IEnumerable and IEnumerator)</h1>
   <p>To begin examining the process of implementing existing .NET interfaces, let’s first look at the role of
IEnumerable and IEnumerator. Recall that C# supports a keyword named foreach that allows you to
iterate over the contents of any array type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Iterate over an array of items.</span>
<span class="kwrd">int</span>[] myArrayOfInts = {10, 20, 30, 40};
<span class="kwrd">foreach</span>(<span class="kwrd">int</span> i <span class="kwrd">in</span> myArrayOfInts)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}</pre>
    <p>While it may seem that only array types can make use of this construct, the truth of the matter is any
type supporting a method named GetEnumerator() can be evaluated by the foreach construct. To
illustrate, begin by creating a new Console Application project named CustomEnumerator. Next, add the
Car.cs and Radio.cs files defined in the SimpleException example of Chapter 7 (via the Project ? Add
Existing Item menu option).</p>
<p><b>Note </b>You may wish to rename the namespace containing the Car and Radio types to CustomEnumerator,
to avoid having to import the CustomException namespace within this new project.</p>
<p>Now, insert a new class named Garage that stores a set of Car objects within a System.Array:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Garage contains a set of Car objects.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Garage
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Car[] carArray = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car[4];

    <span class="rem">// Fill with some Car objects upon startup.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Garage()
    {
        carArray[0] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 30);
        carArray[1] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Clunker"</span>, 55);
        carArray[2] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Zippy"</span>, 30);
        carArray[3] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Fred"</span>, 30);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Ideally, it would be convenient to iterate over the Garage object’s subitems using the foreach
construct, just like an array of data values:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This seems reasonable...</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with IEnumerable / IEnumerator *****\n"</span>);
        Garage carLot = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Garage();

        <span class="rem">// Hand over each car in the collection?</span>
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carLot)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} is going {1} MPH"</span>,
                c.PetName, c.CurrentSpeed);
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Sadly, the compiler informs you that the Garage class does not implement a method named
GetEnumerator(). This method is formalized by the IEnumerable interface, which is found lurking within
the System.Collections namespace.</p>
<p><b>Notes </b>In the next chapter you will learn about the role of generics and the System.Collections.Generic
namespace. As you will see, this namespace contain generic versions of IEnumerable/IEnumerator that provide a
more type-safe way to iterate over subobjects.</p>
<p>Classes or structures that support this behavior advertise that they are able to expose contained
subitems to the caller (in this example, the foreach keyword itself):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This interface informs the caller</span>
<span class="rem">// that the object's subitems can be enumerated.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IEnumerable
{
    IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, the GetEnumerator() method returns a reference to yet another interface named
System.Collections.IEnumerator. This interface provides the infrastructure to allow the caller to traverse
the internal objects contained by the IEnumerable-compatible container:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This interface allows the caller to</span>
<span class="rem">// obtain a container's subitems.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">interface</span> IEnumerator
{
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> MoveNext (); <span class="rem">// Advance the internal position of the cursor.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">object</span> Current { <span class="kwrd">get</span>;} <span class="rem">// Get the current item (read-only property).</span>
    <span class="kwrd">void</span> Reset (); <span class="rem">// Reset the cursor before the first member.</span>
}</pre>
<p>If you wish to update the Garage type to support these interfaces, you could take the long road and
implement each method manually. While you are certainly free to provide customized versions of
GetEnumerator(), MoveNext(), Current, and Reset(), there is a simpler way. As the System.Array type (as
well as many other collection classes) already implements IEnumerable and IEnumerator, you can simply
delegate the request to the System.Array as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.Collections;
...
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Garage : IEnumerable
{
    <span class="rem">// System.Array already implements IEnumerator!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Car[] carArray = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car[4];

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Garage()
    {
        carArray[0] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"FeeFee"</span>, 200, 0);
        carArray[1] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Clunker"</span>, 90, 0);
        carArray[2] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Zippy"</span>, 30, 0);
        carArray[3] = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Fred"</span>, 30, 0);
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Return the array object's IEnumerator.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray.GetEnumerator();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Once you have updated your Garage type, you can now safely use the type within the C# foreach
construct. Furthermore, given that the GetEnumerator() method has been defined publicly, the object
user could also interact with the IEnumerator type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Manually work with IEnumerator.</span>
IEnumerator i = carLot.GetEnumerator();
i.MoveNext();
Car myCar = (Car)i.Current;
Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} is going {1} MPH"</span>, myCar.PetName, myCar.CurrentSpeed);</pre>
<p>However, if you prefer to hide the functionality of IEnumerable from the object level, simply make
use of explicit interface implementation:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
{
    <span class="rem">// Return the array object's IEnumerator.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray.GetEnumerator();
}</pre>
<p>By doing so, the casual object user will not find the Garage’s GetEnumerator() method, while the
foreach construct will obtain the interface in the background when necessary.</p>
    <p><b>Source Code</b> The CustomEnumerator project is located under the Chapter 9 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>Building Iterator Methods with the yield Keyword</h2>
<p>Historically, when you wanted to build a custom collection (such as Garage) that supported foreach
enumeration, implementing the IEnumerable interface (and possibly the IEnumerator interface) was your
only option. However, there’s an alternative way to build types that work with the foreach loop via
iterators.</p>
<p>Simply put, an iterator is a member that specifies how a container’s internal items should be
returned when processed by foreach. While the iterator method must still be named GetEnumerator(),
and the return value must still be of type IEnumerator, your custom class does not need to implement
any of the expected interfaces.</p>
<p>To illustrate, create a new Console Application project named CustomEnumeratorWithYield and
insert the Car, Radio, and Garage types from the previous example (again, renaming your namespace
definitions to the current project if you like). Now, retrofit the current Garage type as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Garage
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Car[] carArray = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car[4];
    ...
    <span class="rem">// Iterator method.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carArray)
        {
            yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> c;
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that this implementation of GetEnumerator() iterates over the subitems using internal
foreach logic and returns each Car to the caller using the yield return syntax. The yield keyword is used
to specify the value (or values) to be returned to the caller’s foreach construct. When the yield return
statement is reached, the current location in the container is stored, and execution is restarted from this
location the next time the iterator is called (you'll see the details behind this “magic” in just a moment).</p>
<p>Iterator methods are not required to make use of the foreach keyword to return its contents. It is
also permissible to define this iterator method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> IEnumerator GetEnumerator()
{
    yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray[0];
    yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray[1];
    yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray[2];
    yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray[3];
}
</pre>
<p>In this implementation, notice that the GetEnumerator() method is explicitly returning a new value
to the caller with each pass through. Doing so for this example makes little sense, given that if we were to
add more objects to the carArray member variable, our GetEnumerator() method would now be out of
sync. Nevertheless, this syntax can be useful when you wish to return local data from a method for
processing by the foreach syntax.</p>
<h2>Building a Named Iterator</h2>
<p>It is also interesting to note that the yield keyword can technically be used within any method,
regardless of its name. These methods (which are technically called named iterators) are also unique in
that they can take any number of arguments. When building a named iterator, be very aware that the
method will return the IEnumerable interface, rather than the expected IEnumerator-compatible type. To
illustrate, you could add the following method to the Garage type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> IEnumerable GetTheCars(<span class="kwrd">bool</span> ReturnRevesed)
{
    <span class="rem">// Return the items in reverse.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (ReturnRevesed)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = carArray.Length; i != 0; i--)
        {
            yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> carArray[i-1];
        }
    }
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Return the items as placed in the array.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carArray)
        {
            yield <span class="kwrd">return</span> c;
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the new method allows the caller to obtain the subitems in sequential order, as well as in
reverse order, if the incoming parameter has the value true. You could now interact with our new
method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with the Yield Keyword *****\n"</span>);
    Garage carLot = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Garage();

    <span class="rem">// Get items using GetEnumerator().</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carLot)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} is going {1} MPH"</span>,
            c.PetName, c.CurrentSpeed);
    }

    Console.WriteLine();

    <span class="rem">// Get items (in reverse!) using named iterator.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (Car c <span class="kwrd">in</span> carLot.GetTheCars(<span class="kwrd">true</span>))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} is going {1} MPH"</span>,
            c.PetName, c.CurrentSpeed);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>As you may agree, named iterators are helpful constructs, in that a single custom container can
define multiple ways to request the returned set.</p>
<h2>Internal Representation of an Iterator Method</h2>
<p>When the C# compiler encounters an iterator method, it dynamically generates a nested class definition
within the scope of the defining type (Garage in this case). The autogenerated nested class implements
the GetEnumerator(), MoveNext(), and Current members on your behalf (oddly, the Reset() method is
not implemented, and you will receive a runtime exception if you attempt to call it). If you load the
current application into ildasm.exe, you’ll find two nested types, each of which accounts for the logic
required by a specific iterator method. Notice in Figure 9-8 that these compiler-generated types have
been named &lt;GetEnumerator&gt;d__0 and &lt;GetTheCars&gt;d__6.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure09_08.png" alt="Figure 9-8" />
<p><b>Figure 9-8.</b> Iterator methods are internally implemented with the help of an autogenerated nested class</p> 
<p>If you use ildasm.exe to view the implementation of the GetEnumerator() method of the Garage type,
you’d find that it has been implemented to make use of the &lt;GetEnumerator&gt;d__0 type behind the scenes
(the nested &lt;GetTheCars&gt;d__6 type is used by the GetTheCars() method in a similar manner).</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method public hidebysig instance class
	[mscorlib]System.Collections.IEnumerator
	GetEnumerator() cil managed
{
...
	newobj instance void
		CustomEnumeratorWithYield.Garage/'<GetEnumerator>d__0'::.ctor(int32)
...
} // end of method Garage::GetEnumerator
            </pre>
<p>So, to wrap up our look at building enumerable objects, remember that for your custom types to
work with the C# foreach keyword, the container must define a method named GetEnumerator(), which
has been formalized by the IEnumerable interface type. The implementation of this method is typically
achieved by simply delegating it to the internal member that is holding onto the subobjects; however, it
is also possible to make use of the yield return syntax to provide multiple “named iterator” methods.</p>
