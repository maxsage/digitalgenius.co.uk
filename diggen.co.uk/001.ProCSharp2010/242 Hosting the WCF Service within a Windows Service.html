<h1>Hosting the WCF Service within a Windows Service</h1>
<p>Hosting a WCF service from within a console application (or within a GUI desktop application, for that
matter) is not an ideal choice for a production-level server, given that the host must remain running
visibly in the background to service clients. Even if you were to minimize the hosting application to the
Windows taskbar, it would still be far too easy to accidentally shut down the host, thereby terminating
the connection with any client applications.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> While it is true that a desktop Windows application does not have to show a main window, a typical *.exe
does require user interaction to load the executable. However, you can configure a Windows service (described
next) to run even if no users are currently logged on to the workstation.</p>
<p>If you build an in-house WCF application, another alternative you have is to host your WCF service
library from within a dedicated Windows service. One benefit of doing so is that you can configure a
Windows service to start automatically when the target machine boots up. Another benefit is that
Windows services run invisibly in the background (unlike your console application) and do not require
user interactivity.</p>
<p>Next, you will learn how to build such a host. Begin by creating a new Windows service project
named MathWindowsServiceHost (see Figure 25-12). Once you do this, rename your initial Service1.cs
file to MathWinService.cs using Solution Explorer.</p>

<h2>Specifying the ABCs in Code</h2>
<p>Now assume you have set a reference to your MathServiceLibrary.dll and System.ServiceModel.dll
assemblies. All you need to do is use the ServiceHost type in the OnStart() and OnStop() methods of
your Windows service type. Open the code file for your service host class (by right-clicking the designer
and selecting View Code) and add the following logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Be sure to import these namespaces:</span>
<span class="kwrd">using</span> MathServiceLibrary;
<span class="kwrd">using</span> System.ServiceModel;

<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MathWindowsServuceHost
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MathWinService: ServiceBase
    {
        <span class="rem">// A member variable of type ServiceHost.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">private</span> ServiceHost myHost;
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> MathWinService()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnStart(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            <span class="rem">// Just to be really safe.</span>
            <span class="kwrd">if</span> (myHost != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
            {
                myHost.Close();
                myHost = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
            }
        
            <span class="rem">// Create the host.</span>
            myHost = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ServiceHost(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(MathService));

            <span class="rem">// The ABCs in code!</span>
            Uri address = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"http://localhost:8080/MathServiceLibrary"</span>);
            WSHttpBinding binding = <span class="kwrd">new</span> WSHttpBinding();
            Type contract = <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(IBasicMath);

            <span class="rem">// Add this endpoint.</span>
            myHost.AddServiceEndpoint(contract, binding, address);

            <span class="rem">// Open the host.</span>
            myHost.Open();
        }

        <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnStop()
        {
            <span class="rem">// Shut down the host.</span>
            <span class="kwrd">if</span>(myHost != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
                myHost.Close();
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>While nothing prevents you from using a configuration file when building a Windows service host
for a WCF service, here (for a change of pace) you establish the endpoint programmatically using the
Uri, WSHttpBinding, and Type classes, rather than by using a *.config file. Once you create each aspect of
the ABCs, you inform the host programmatically by calling AddServiceEndpoint().</p>
<p>If you wish to inform the runtime that you want to gain access to each of the default endpoint
bindings stored in the .NET 4.0 machine.config file, you can simplify your programming logic by
specifying base addresses when you invoke the constructor of ServiceHost. In this case, you do not need
to specify the ABCs manually in code or call AddServiceEndpoint(); instead, you call
AddDefaultEndpoints(). Consider the following update:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> OnStart(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (myHost != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
    {
        myHost.Close();
    }

    <span class="rem">// Create the host and specify a URL for an HTTP binding.</span>
    myHost = <span class="kwrd">new</span> ServiceHost(<span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(MathService),
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> Uri(<span class="str">"http://localhost:8080/MathServiceLibrary"</span>));

    <span class="rem">// Opt in for the default endpoints!</span>
    myHost.AddDefaultEndpoints();

    <span class="rem">// Open the host.</span>
    myHost.Open();
}</pre>
<h2>Enabling MEX</h2>
<p>While you could enable MEX programmatically as well, here you will opt for a WCF 4.0 configuration file.
Insert a new App.config file into your Windows service project that contains the following default MEX
settings:</p>

<h2>Creating a Windows Service Installer</h2>
<p>To register your Windows service with the operating system, you need to add an installer to your project
that contains the necessary code to allow you to register the service. To do so, right-click the Windows
service designer surface and select Add Installer (see Figure 25-13).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure25_13.png" alt="Figure 25-13" />
<p><b>Figure 25-13</b> Adding an installer for the Windows service</p>
<p>Once you do this, you can see two components have been added to a new designer surface
representing the installer. The first component (named serviceProcessInstaller1 by default) represents
an item that can install a new Windows service on the target machine. Select this item on the designer
and use the Properties window to set the Account property to LocalSystem (see Figure 25-14).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure25_14.png" alt="Figure 25-14" />
<p><b>Figure 25-14</b> Be sure to run the Windows service as a local system account</p>
<p>The second component (named serviceInstaller1) represents a type that will install your
particular Windows service. Again, use the Properties window to change the ServiceName property to
MathService (as you might have guessed, this represents the friendly display name of the registered
Windows service), set the StartType property to Automatic, and add a friendly description of your
Windows service using the Description property (see Figure 25-15).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure25_15.png" alt="Figure 25-15" />
<p><b>Figure 25-15</b> Configuring installer details</p>
<p>At this point, you can compile your application.</p>
<h2>Installing the Windows Service</h2>
<p>A Windows service can be installed on the host machine using a traditional setup program (such as an
*.msi installer) or via the installutil.exe command-line tool. Using a Visual Studio 2010 command
prompt, change into the \bin\Debug folder of your MathWindowsServiceHost project. Now, enter the
following command:</p>
<pre class="cmdline">
installutil MathWindowsServiceHost.exe</pre>
<p>Assuming the installation succeeded, you can now open the Services applet located under the
Administrative Tools folder of your Control Panel. You should see the friendly name of your Windows
service listed alphabetically. Once you locate it, make sure you start the service on your local machine
using the Start link (see Figure 25-16).</p>

<p>Now that the service is alive and kicking, the last step is to build a client application to consume its
services.</p>
