<h1>Processing Multiple Exceptions</h1>
 <p>In its simplest form, a try block has a single catch block. In reality, though, you often run into situations
where the statements within a try block could trigger numerous possible exceptions. Create a new C#
Console Application project named ProcessMultipleExceptions, add the Car.cs, Radio.cs, and
CarIsDeadException.cs files from the previous CustomException example into the new project (via
Project ? Add Existing Item), and update your namespace names accordingly.</p>
<p>Now, update the Car’s Accelerate() method to also throw a predefined base class library
ArgumentOutOfRangeException if you pass an invalid parameter (which we will assume is any value less
than zero). Note the constructor of this exception class takes the name of the offending argument as the
first string, followed by a message describing the error.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Test for invalid argument before proceeding.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Accelerate(<span class="kwrd">int</span> delta)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span>(delta &lt; 0)
        <span class="kwrd">throw</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span>
            ArgumentOutOfRangeException(<span class="str">"delta"</span>, <span class="str">"Speed must be greater than zero!"</span>);
    ...
}</pre>
<p>The catch logic could now specifically respond to each type of exception:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Handling Multiple Exceptions *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 90);
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Trip Arg out of range exception.</span>
        myCar.Accelerate(-10);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (CarIsDeadException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (ArgumentOutOfRangeException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>When you are authoring multiple catch blocks, you must be aware that when an exception is
thrown, it will be processed by the “first available” catch. To illustrate exactly what the “first available”
catch means, assume you retrofitted the previous logic with an additional catch scope that attempts to
handle all exceptions beyond CarIsDeadException and ArgumentOutOfRangeException by catching a
general System.Exception as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This code will not compile!</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Handling Multiple Exceptions *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 90);

    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Trigger an argument out of range exception.</span>
        myCar.Accelerate(-10);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(Exception e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Process all other exceptions?</span>
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (CarIsDeadException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (ArgumentOutOfRangeException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>This exception-handling logic generates compile-time errors. The problem is due to the fact that the
first catch block can handle anything derived from System.Exception (given the “is-a” relationship),
including the CarIsDeadException and ArgumentOutOfRangeException types. Therefore, the final two
catch blocks are unreachable!</p>
<p>The rule of thumb to keep in mind is to make sure your catch blocks are structured such that the
very first catch is the most specific exception (i.e., the most derived type in an exception-type
inheritance chain), leaving the final catch for the most general (i.e., the base class of a given exception
inheritance chain, in this case System.Exception).</p>
<p>Thus, if you wish to define a catch block that will handle any errors beyond CarIsDeadException and
ArgumentOutOfRangeException, you could write the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This code compiles just fine.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Handling Multiple Exceptions *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 90);
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Trigger an argument out of range exception.</span>
        myCar.Accelerate(-10);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (CarIsDeadException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (ArgumentOutOfRangeException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    <span class="rem">// This will catch any other exception</span>
    <span class="rem">// beyond CarIsDeadException or</span>
    <span class="rem">// ArgumentOutOfRangeException.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p><b>Note </b>Where at all possible, always favor catching specific exception classes, rather than a general
System.Exception. Though it might appear to make life simple in the short term (you may think, “Ah! This catches
all the other things I don’t care about.”), in the long term you could end up with strange runtime crashes, as a
more serious error was not directly dealt with in your code. Remember, a final catch block that deals with
System.Exception tends to be very general indeed.</p>
<h2>General catch Statements</h2>
<p>C# also supports a “general” catch scope that does not explicitly receive the exception object thrown by
a given member:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// A generic catch.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Handling Multiple Exceptions *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 90);
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        myCar.Accelerate(90);
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Something bad happened..."</span>);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Obviously, this is not the most informative way to handle exceptions, since you have no way to
obtain meaningful data about the error that occurred (such as the method name, call stack, or custom
message). Nevertheless, C# does allow for such a construct, which can be helpful when you want to
handle all errors in a very, very general fashion.</p>
<h2>Rethrowing Exceptions</h2>
 <p>When you catch an exception, it is permissible for the logic in a try block to rethrow the exception up the
call stack to the previous caller. To do so, simply use the throw keyword within a catch block. This passes
the exception up the chain of calling logic, which can be helpful if your catch block is only able to
partially handle the error at hand:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Passing the buck.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Speed up car logic...</span>
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(CarIsDeadException e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Do any partial processing of this error and pass the buck.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">throw</span>;
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>Be aware that in this example code, the ultimate receiver of CarIsDeadException is the CLR, since it
is the Main() method rethrowing the exception. Because of this, your end user is presented with a
system-supplied error dialog box. Typically, you would only rethrow a partial handled exception to a
caller that has the ability to handle the incoming exception more gracefully.</p>
<p>Notice as well that we are not explicitly rethrowing the CarIsDeadException object, but rather
making use of the throw keyword with no argument. We’re not creating a new exception object; we’re
just rethrowing the original exception object (with all its original information). Doing so preserves the
context of the original target.</p>
<h2>Inner Exceptions</h2>
  <p>As you may suspect, it is entirely possible to trigger an exception at the time you are handling another
exception. For example, assume you are handling a CarIsDeadException within a particular catch scope,
and during the process you attempt to record the stack trace to a file on your C: drive named
carErrors.txt (you must specify you are using the System.IO namespace to gain access to these I/Ocentric
types):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">catch</span>(CarIsDeadException e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Attempt to open a file named carErrors.txt on the C drive.</span>
    FileStream fs = File.Open(<span class="str">@"C:\carErrors.txt"</span>, FileMode.Open);
    ...
}</pre>
<p>Now, if the specified file is not located on your C: drive, the call to File.Open() results in a
FileNotFoundException! Later in this text, you will learn all about the System.IO namespace where you’ll
discover how to programmatically determine whether a file exists on the hard drive before attempting to
open the file in the first place (thereby avoiding the exception altogether). However, to stay focused on
the topic of exceptions, assume the exception has been raised.</p>
<p>When you encounter an exception while processing another exception, best practice states that you
should record the new exception object as an “inner exception” within a new object of the same type as
the initial exception. (That was a mouthful!) The reason you need to allocate a new object of the
exception being handled is that the only way to document an inner exception is via a constructor
parameter. Consider the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">catch</span> (CarIsDeadException e)
{
    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        FileStream fs = File.Open(<span class="str">@"C:\carErrors.txt"</span>, FileMode.Open);
        ...
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span> (Exception e2)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Throw an exception that records the new exception,</span>
        <span class="rem">// as well as the message of the first exception.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">throw</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> CarIsDeadException(e.Message, e2);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice in this case, we have passed in the FileNotFoundException object as the second parameter to
the CarIsDeadException constructor. Once we have configured this new object, we throw it up the call
stack to the next caller, which in this case would be the Main() method.</p>
<p>Given that there is no “next caller” after Main() to catch the exception, we would be again presented
with an error dialog box. Much like the act of rethrowing an exception, recording inner exceptions is
usually only useful when the caller has the ability to gracefully catch the exception in the first place. If
this is the case, the caller’s catch logic can make use of the InnerException property to extract the details
of the inner exception object.</p>
<h2>The Finally Block</h2>
  <p>A try/catch scope may also define an optional finally block. The purpose of a finally block is to ensure
that a set of code statements will always execute, exception (of any type) or not. To illustrate, assume
you wish to always power down the car’s radio before exiting Main(), regardless of any handled
exception:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Handling Multiple Exceptions *****\n"</span>);
    Car myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Car(<span class="str">"Rusty"</span>, 90);
    myCar.CrankTunes(<span class="kwrd">true</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">try</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// Speed up car logic.</span>
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(CarIsDeadException e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Process CarIsDeadException.</span>
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(ArgumentOutOfRangeException e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Process ArgumentOutOfRangeException.</span>
    }
    <span class="kwrd">catch</span>(Exception e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Process any other Exception.</span>
    }
    <span class="kwrd">finally</span>
    {
        <span class="rem">// This will always occur. Exception or not.</span>
        myCar.CrankTunes(<span class="kwrd">false</span>);
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>If you did not include a finally block, the radio would not be turned off if an exception is
encountered (which may or may not be problematic). In a more real-world scenario, when you need to
dispose of objects, close a file, detach from a database (or whatever), a finally block ensures a location
for proper cleanup.</p>
