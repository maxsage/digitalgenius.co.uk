<h1>The System.Threading Namespace</h1>
<p>Under the .NET platform, the System.Threading namespace provides a number of types that enable the
direct construction of multithreaded applications. In addition to providing types that allow you to
interact with a particular CLR thread, this namespace defines types that allow access to the CLR
maintained thread pool, a simple (non–GUI-based) Timer class, and numerous types used to provide
synchronized access to shared resources. Table 19-1 lists some of the core members of this namespace.
(Be sure to consult the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details.)</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Interlocked
   </td>
   <td>
    This type provides atomic operations for variables that are
shared by multiple threads.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Monitor
   </td>
   <td>
    This type provides the synchronization of threading
objects using locks and wait/signals. The C# lock keyword
makes use of a Monitor object under the hood.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Mutex
   </td>
   <td>
    This synchronization primitive can be used for
synchronization between application domain boundaries.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ParameterizedThreadStart
   </td>
   <td>
    This delegate allows a thread to call methods that take any
number of arguments.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Semaphore
   </td>
   <td>
    This type allows you to limit the number of threads that
can access a resource, or a particular type of resource,
concurrently.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Thread
   </td>
   <td>
    This type represents a thread that executes within the CLR.
Using this type, you are able to spawn additional threads
in the originating AppDomain.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ThreadPool
   </td>
   <td>
    This type allows you to interact with the CLR-maintained
thread pool within a given process.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ThreadPriority
   </td>
   <td>
    This enum represents a thread’s priority level (Highest,
Normal, etc.).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ThreadStart
   </td>
   <td>
    This delegate is used to specify the method to call for a
given thread. Unlike the ParameterizedThreadStart
delegate, targets of ThreadStart must always have the
same prototype.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    ThreadState
   </td>
   <td>
    This enum specifies the valid states a thread may take
(Running, Aborted, etc.).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Timer
   </td>
   <td>
    This type provides a mechanism for executing a method at
specified intervals.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    TimerCallback
   </td>
   <td>
    This delegate type is used in conjunction with Timer types.
