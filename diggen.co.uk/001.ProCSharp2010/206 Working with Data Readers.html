<h1>Working with Data Readers</h1>
<p>Once you establish the active connection and SQL command, the next step is to submit the query to the
data source. As you might guess, you have a number of ways to do this. The DbDataReader type (which
implements IDataReader) is the simplest and fastest way to obtain information from a data store. Recall
that data readers represent a read-only, forward-only stream of data returned one record at a time.
Given this, data readers are useful only when submitting SQL selection statements to the underlying
data store.</p>
<p>Data readers are useful when you need to iterate over large amounts of data quickly and you do not
need to maintain an in-memory representation. For example, if you request 20,000 records from a table
to store in a text file, it would be rather memory-intensive to hold this information in a DataSet (because
a DataSet holds the entire result of the query in memory at the same time).</p>
<p>A better approach is to create a data reader that spins over each record as rapidly as possible. Be
aware, however, that data reader objects (unlike data adapter objects, which you’ll examine later)
maintain an open connection to their data source until you explicitly close the connection.</p>
<p>You obtain data reader objects from the command object using a call to ExecuteReader().The data
reader represents the current record it has read from the database. The data reader has an indexer
method (e.g, [] syntax in C#) that allows you to access a column in the current record. You can access the
column either by name or by zero-based integer.</p>
<p>The following use of the data reader leverages the Read() method to determine when you have
reached the end of your records (using a false return value). For each incoming record that you read
from the database, you use the type indexer to print out the make, pet name, and color of each
automobile. Also note that you call Close() as soon as you finish processing the records; this frees up the
connection object:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Obtain a data reader via ExecuteReader().</span>
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(SqlDataReader myDataReader = myCommand.ExecuteReader())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Loop over the results.</span>
        while (myDataReader.Read())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"-&gt; Make: {0}, PetName: {1}, Color: {2}."</span>,
                myDataReader[<span class="str">"Make"</span>].ToString(),
                myDataReader[<span class="str">"PetName"</span>].ToString(),
                myDataReader[<span class="str">"Color"</span>].ToString());
        }
    }
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>In the preceding snippet, you overload the indexer of a data reader object to take either a string
(representing the name of the column) or an int (representing the column’s ordinal position). Thus, you
can clean up the current reader logic (and avoid hard-coded string names) with the following update
(note the use of the FieldCount property):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
while (myDataReader.Read())
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Record *****"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; myDataReader.FieldCount; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} = {1} "</span>,
        myDataReader.GetName(i),
        myDataReader.GetValue(i).ToString());
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>If you compile and run your project at this point, you should see a list of all automobiles in the
Inventory table of the AutoLot database. The following output shows the initial few records from my own
version of AutoLot:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Data Readers *****

***** Info about your connection *****
Database location: (local)\SQLEXPRESS
Database name: AutoLot
Timeout: 30
Connection state: Open

***** Record *****
CarID = 83

PetName = Rusty

***** Record *****
CarID = 107
Make = Ford
Color = Red
PetName = Snake</pre>
<h2>Obtaining Multiple Result Sets Using a Data Reader</h2>
<p>Data reader objects can obtain multiple result sets using a single command object. For example, if you
want to obtain all rows from the Inventory table, as well as all rows from the Customers table, you can
specify both SQL select statements using a semicolon delimiter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">string</span> strSQL = <span class="str">"Select * From Inventory;Select * from Customers"</span>;</pre>
<p>Once you obtain the data reader, you can iterate over each result set using the NextResult()
method. Note that you are always returned the first result set automatically. Thus, if you wish to read
over the rows of each table, you can build the following iteration construct:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">do</span>
{
    while (myDataReader.Read())
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Record *****"</span>);
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; myDataReader.FieldCount; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} = {1}"</span>,
                myDataReader.GetName(i),
                myDataReader.GetValue(i).ToString());
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
} while (myDataReader.NextResult());</pre>
<p>At this point, you should be more aware of the functionality data reader objects bring to the table.
Always remember that a data reader can only process SQL Select statements; you cannot use them to
modify an existing database table using Insert, Update, or Delete requests. Modifying an existing
database requires additional investigation of command objects.</p>
