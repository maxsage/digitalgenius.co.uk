<h1>Defining Type Members in CIL</h1>
<p>As you are already aware, .NET types may support various members. Enumerations have some set of
name/value pairs. Structures and classes may have constructors, fields, methods, properties, static
members, and so on. Over the course of this book’s first 16 chapters, you have already seen partial CIL
definitions for the items previously mentioned, but nevertheless, here is a quick recap of how various
members map to CIL primitives.</p>
<h2>Defining Field Data in CIL</h2>
<p>Enumerations, structures, and classes can all support field data. In each case, the .field directive will be
used. For example, let’s breathe some life into the skeleton MyEnum enumeration and define three
name/value pairs (note the values are specified within parentheses):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.class public sealed enum MyEnum
{
    .field public static literal valuetype
        MyNamespace.MyEnum A = int32(0)
    .field public static literal valuetype
        MyNamespace.MyEnum B = int32(1)
    .field public static literal valuetype
        MyNamespace.MyEnum C = int32(2)
}</pre>
<p>Fields that reside within the scope of a .NET System.Enum-derived type are qualified using the static
and literal attributes. As you would guess, these attributes set up the field data to be a fixed value
accessible from the type itself (e.g., MyEnum.A).</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The values assigned to an enum value may also be in hexadecimal with an 0x prefix.</p>
<p>Of course, when you wish to define a point of field data within a class or structure, you are not
limited to a point of public static literal data. For example, you could update MyBaseClass to support two
points of private, instance-level field data, set to default values:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.class public MyBaseClass
{
    .field private string stringField = "hello!"
    .field private int32 intField = int32(42)
}
</pre>
<p>As in C#, class field data will automatically be initialized to an appropriate default value. If you wish
to allow the object user to supply custom values at the time of creation for each of these points of private
field data, you (of course) need to create custom constructors.</p>
<h2>Defining Type Constructors in CIL</h2>
<p>The CTS supports both instance-level and class-level (static) constructors. In terms of CIL, instance-level
constructors are represented using the .ctor token, while a static-level constructor is expressed via
.cctor (class constructor). Both of these CIL tokens must be qualified using the rtspecialname (return
type special name) and specialname attributes. Simply put, these attributes are used to identify a specific
CIL token that can be treated in unique ways by a given .NET language. For example, in C#, constructors
do not define a return type; however, in terms of CIL, the return value of a constructor is indeed void:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.class public MyBaseClass
{
    .field private string stringField
    .field private int32 intField

    .method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname
        instance void .ctor(string s, int32 i) cil managed
    {
        // TODO: Add implementation code...
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that the .ctor directive has been qualified with the instance attribute (as it is not a static
constructor). The cil managed attributes denote that the scope of this method contains CIL code, rather
than unmanaged code, which may be used during platform invocation requests.</p>
<h2>Defining Properties in CIL</h2>
<p>Properties and methods also have specific CIL representations. By way of an example, if MyBaseClass
were updated to support a public property named TheString, you would author the following CIL (note
again the use of the specialname attribute):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
.class public MyBaseClass
{
...
    .method public hidebysig specialname
        instance string get_TheString() cil managed
    {
        // TODO: Add implementation code...
    }

    .method public hidebysig specialname
        instance void set_TheString(string 'value') cil managed
    {
        // TODO: Add implementation code...
    }   

    .property instance string TheString()
    {
        .get instance string
            MyNamespace.MyBaseClass::get_TheString()
        .set instance void
            MyNamespace.MyBaseClass::set_TheString(string)
    }
}</pre>
<p>Recall that in terms of CIL, a property maps to a pair of methods that take get_ and set_ prefixes.
The .property directive makes use of the related .get and .set directives to map property syntax to the
correct “specially named” methods.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Notice that the incoming parameter to the set method of a property is placed in single-tick quotation
marks, which represents the name of the token to use on the right-hand side of the assignment operator within
the method scope.</p>
<h2>Defining Member Parameters</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, specifying arguments in CIL is (more or less) identical to doing so in C#. For example, each
argument is defined by specifying its data type followed by the parameter name. Furthermore, like C#,
CIL provides a way to define input, output, and pass-by-reference parameters. As well, CIL allows you to
define a parameter array argument (aka the C# params keyword) as well as optional parameters (which
are not supported in C# but are used in VB).</p>
<p>To illustrate the process of defining parameters in raw CIL, assume you wish to build a method that
takes an int32 (by value), an int32 (by reference), a [mscorlib]System.Collection.ArrayList, and a
single output parameter (of type int32). In terms of C#, this method would look something like the
following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MyMethod(<span class="kwrd">int</span> inputInt,
    <span class="kwrd">ref</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> refInt, ArrayList ar, <span class="kwrd">out</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> outputInt)
{
    outputInt = 0; <span class="rem">// Just to satisfy the C# compiler...</span>
}</pre>
<p>If you were to map this method into CIL terms, you would find that C# reference parameters are
marked with an ampersand (&amp;) suffixed to the parameter’s underlying data type (int32&amp;).</p>
<p>Output parameters also make use of the &amp; suffix, but they are further qualified using the CIL [out]
token. Also notice that if the parameter is a reference type (in this case, the
[mscorlib]System.Collections.ArrayList type), the class token is prefixed to the data type (not to be
confused with the .class directive!):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
.method <span class="kwrd">public</span> hidebysig <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> MyMethod(int32 inputInt,
    int32&amp; refInt,
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> [mscorlib]System.Collections.ArrayList ar,
    [<span class="kwrd">out</span>] int32&amp; outputInt) cil managed
{
    ...
}</pre>
