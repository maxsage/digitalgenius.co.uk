<h1>Invoking a Method Asynchronously</h1>
<p>To instruct the BinaryOp delegate to invoke Add() asynchronously, you will modify the logic in the
previous project (feel free to add code to the existing project, however in your lab downloads, you will
find a new Console Application named AsyncDelegate). Update the previous Main() method as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Async Delegate Invocation *****"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Print out the ID of the executing thread.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Main() invoked on thread {0}."</span>,
        Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
    
    <span class="rem">// Invoke Add() on a secondary thread.</span>
    BinaryOp b = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BinaryOp(Add);
    IAsyncResult iftAR = b.BeginInvoke(10, 10, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="kwrd">null</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Do other work on primary thread...</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Doing more work in Main()!"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Obtain the result of the Add()</span>
    <span class="rem">// method when ready.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> answer = b.EndInvoke(iftAR);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"10 + 10 is {0}."</span>, answer);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>If you run this application, you will find that two unique thread IDs are displayed, given that there
are in fact multiple threads working within the current AppDomain:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Async Delegate Invocation *****
Main() invoked on thread 1.
Doing more work in Main()!
Add() invoked on thread 3.
10 + 10 is 20.
</pre>
<p>In addition to the unique ID values, you will also notice upon running the application that the Doing
more work in Main()! message displays immediately, while the secondary thread is occupied attending
to its business.</p>
<h2>Synchronizing the Calling Thread</h2>
<p>If you think carefully about the current implementation of Main(), you might have realized that the time
span between calling BeginInvoke() and EndInvoke() is clearly less than five seconds. Therefore, once
Doing more work in Main()! prints to the console, the calling thread is now blocked and waiting for the
secondary thread to complete before being able to obtain the result of the Add() method. Therefore, you
are effectively making yet another synchronous call:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    BinaryOp b = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BinaryOp(Add);

    <span class="rem">// Once the next statement is processed,</span>
    <span class="rem">// the calling thread is now blocked until</span>
    <span class="rem">// BeginInvoke() completes.</span>
    IAsyncResult iftAR = b.BeginInvoke(10, 10, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="kwrd">null</span>);

    <span class="rem">// This call takes far less than five seconds!</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Doing more work in Main()!"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> answer = b.EndInvoke(iftAR);
...
}</pre>
<p>Obviously, asynchronous delegates would lose their appeal if the calling thread had the potential of
being blocked under various circumstances. To allow the calling thread to discover if the
asynchronously invoked method has completed its work, the IAsyncResult interface provides the
IsCompleted property. Using this member, the calling thread is able to determine whether the
asynchronous call has indeed completed before calling EndInvoke().</p>
<p>If the method has not completed, IsCompleted returns false, and the calling thread is free to carry
on its work. If IsCompleted returns true, the calling thread is able to obtain the result in the “least
blocking manner” possible. Ponder the following update to the Main() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    BinaryOp b = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BinaryOp(Add);
    IAsyncResult iftAR = b.BeginInvoke(10, 10, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="kwrd">null</span>);

    <span class="rem">// This message will keep printing until</span>
    <span class="rem">// the Add() method is finished.</span>
    while(!iftAR.IsCompleted)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Doing more work in Main()!"</span>);
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
    <span class="rem">// Now we know the Add() method is complete.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> answer = b.EndInvoke(iftAR);
...
}</pre>
<p>Here, you enter a loop that will continue processing the Console.WriteLine() statement until the
secondary thread has completed. Once this has occurred, you can obtain the result of the Add() method
knowing full well the method has indeed completed. The call to Thread.Sleep(1000) is not necessary for
this particular application to function correctly; however, by forcing the primary thread to wait for
approximately one second during each iteration, it prevents the same message from printing hundreds
of times. Here is the output (your output may differ slightly, based on the speed of your machine and
when threads come to life):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Async Delegate Invocation *****
Main() invoked on thread 1.
Doing more work in Main()!
Add() invoked on thread 3.
Doing more work in Main()!
Doing more work in Main()!
Doing more work in Main()!
Doing more work in Main()!
Doing more work in Main()!
10 + 10 is 20.
</pre>
<p>In addition to the IsCompleted property, the IAsyncResult interface provides the AsyncWaitHandle
property for more flexible waiting logic. This property returns an instance of the WaitHandle type, which
exposes a method named WaitOne(). The benefit of WaitHandle.WaitOne() is that you can specify the
maximum wait time. If the specified amount of time is exceeded, WaitOne() returns false. Ponder the
following updated while loop, which no longer makes use of a call to Thread.Sleep():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
while (!iftAR.AsyncWaitHandle.WaitOne(1000, <span class="kwrd">true</span>))
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Doing more work in Main()!"</span>);
}</pre>
<p>While these properties of IAsyncResult do provide a way to synchronize the calling thread, they are
not the most efficient approach. In many ways, the IsCompleted property is much like a really annoying
manager (or classmate) who is constantly asking, “Are you done yet?” Thankfully, delegates provide a
number of additional (and more elegant) techniques to obtain the result of a method that has been
called asynchronously.</p>
<p><b>Source Code</b> The AsyncDelegate project is located under the Chapter 19 subdirectory.</p>
<h2>The Role of the AsyncCallback Delegate</h2>
<p>Rather than polling a delegate to determine whether an asynchronously invoked method has completed,
it would be more efficient to have the secondary thread inform the calling thread when the task is
finished. When you wish to enable this behavior, you will need to supply an instance of the
System.AsyncCallback delegate as a parameter to BeginInvoke(), which up until this point has been null.
However, when you do supply an AsyncCallback object, the delegate will call the specified method
automatically when the asynchronous call has completed.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The callback method will be called on the secondary thread not the primary thread. This has important
implications when using threads within a graphical user interface (WPF or Windows Forms) as controls have
thread-affinity, meaning they can only be manipulated by the thread which created them. You’ll see some
examples of working the threads from a GUI later in this chapter during the examination of the Task Parallel
Library (TPL).</p>
<p>Like any delegate, AsyncCallback can only invoke methods that match a specific pattern, which in
this case is a method taking IAsyncResult as the sole parameter and returning nothing:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Targets of AsyncCallback must match the following pattern.</span>
<span class="kwrd">void</span> MyAsyncCallbackMethod(IAsyncResult itfAR)</pre>
<p>Assume you have another Console Application (AsyncCallbackDelegate ) making use of the
BinaryOp delegate. This time, however, you will not poll the delegate to determine whether the Add()
method has completed. Rather, you will define a static method named AddComplete() to receive the
notification that the asynchronous invocation is finished. Also, this example makes use of a class level
static bool field, which will be used to keep the primary thread in Main() running a task until the
secondary thread is finished.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The use of this Boolean variable in this example is strictly speaking, not thread safe, as there are two
different threads which have access to its value. This will be permissible for the current example; however, as a
very good rule of thumb, you must ensure data that can be shared among multiple threads is locked down. You’ll
see how to do so later in this chapter.</p>

            isDone = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>Again, the static AddComplete() method will be invoked by the AsyncCallback delegate when the
Add() method has completed. If you run this program, you can confirm that the secondary thread is the
thread invoking the AddComplete() callback:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** AsyncCallbackDelegate Example *****
Main() invoked on thread 1.
Add() invoked on thread 3.
Working....
Working....
Working....
Working....
Working....
AddComplete() invoked on thread 3.
Your addition complete</pre>
<p>Like other examples in this chapter, your output may be slightly different. In fact, you may see one
final “Working…” printout occur after the addition is complete. This is just a byproduct of the forced 1-
second delay in Main().</p>
<h2>The Role of the AsyncResult Class</h2>
<p>Currently, the AddComplete() method is not printing out the actual result of the operation (adding two
numbers). The reason is that the target of the AsyncCallback delegate (AddComplete() in this example)
does not have access to the original BinaryOp delegate created in the scope of Main(), and therefore you
can’t call EndInvoke() from within AddComplete()!</p>
<p>While you could simply declare the BinaryOp variable as a static member variable in the class to
allow both methods to access the same object, a more elegant solution is to use the incoming
IAsyncResult parameter.</p>
<p>The incoming IAsyncResult parameter passed into the target of the AsyncCallback delegate is
actually an instance of the AsyncResult class (note the lack of an I prefix) defined in the System.
Runtime.Remoting.Messaging namespace. The static AsyncDelegate property returns a reference to the
original asynchronous delegate that was created elsewhere.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you wish to obtain a reference to the BinaryOp delegate object allocated within Main(),
simply cast the System.Object returned by the AsyncDelegate property into type BinaryOp. At this point,
you can trigger EndInvoke() as expected:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Don't forget to import</span>
<span class="rem">// System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging!</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddComplete(IAsyncResult itfAR)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"AddComplete() invoked on thread {0}."</span>,
        Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Your addition is complete"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Now get the result.</span>
    AsyncResult ar = (AsyncResult)itfAR;
    BinaryOp b = (BinaryOp)ar.AsyncDelegate;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"10 + 10 is {0}."</span>, b.EndInvoke(itfAR));
    isDone = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
}</pre>
<h2>Passing and Receiving Custom State Data</h2>
<p>The final aspect of asynchronous delegates you need to address is the final argument to the
BeginInvoke() method (which has been null up to this point). This parameter allows you to pass
additional state information to the callback method from the primary thread. Because this argument is
prototyped as a System.Object, you can pass in any type of data whatsoever, as long as the callback
method knows what to expect. Assume for the sake of demonstration that the primary thread wishes to
pass in a custom text message to the AddComplete() method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    IAsyncResult iftAR = b.BeginInvoke(10, 10,
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> AsyncCallback(AddComplete),
    <span class="str">"Main() thanks you for adding these numbers."</span>);
...
}</pre>
<p>To obtain this data within the scope of AddComplete(), make use of the AsyncState property of the
incoming IAsyncResult parameter. Notice that an explicit cast will be required; therefore the primary
and secondary threads must agree on the underlying type returned from AsyncState.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> AddComplete(IAsyncResult itfAR)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Retrieve the informational object and cast it to string.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> msg = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)itfAR.AsyncState;
    Console.WriteLine(msg);
    isDone = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
}</pre>
<p>Here is the output of the final iteration:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** AsyncCallbackDelegate Example *****
Main() invoked on thread 1.
Add() invoked on thread 3.
Working....
Working....
Working....

<p>Now that you understand how a .NET delegate can be used to automatically spin off a secondary
thread of execution to handle an asynchronous method invocation, let’s turn attention to directly
interacting with threads using the System.Threading namespace.</p>
