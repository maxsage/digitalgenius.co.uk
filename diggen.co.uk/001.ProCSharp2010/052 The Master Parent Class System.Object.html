<h1>The Master Parent Class: System.Object</h1>
<p>To wrap up this chapter, I’d like to examine the details of the master parent class in the .NET platform:
Object. As you were reading the previous section, you may have noticed that the base classes in your
hierarchies (Car, Shape, Employee) never explicitly specify their parent classes:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Who is the parent of Car?</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car
{...}</pre>
<p>In the .NET universe, every type ultimately derives from a base class named System.Object (which
can be represented by the C# object keyword [lowercase ‘o’]). The Object class defines a set of common
members for every type in the framework. In fact, when you do build a class that does not explicitly
define its parent, the compiler automatically derives your type from Object. If you want to be very clear
in your intentions, you are free to define classes that derive from Object as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Here we are explicitly deriving from System.Object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Car : <span class="kwrd">object</span>
{...}</pre>
<p>Like any class, System.Object defines a set of members. In the following formal C# definition, note
that some of these items are declared virtual, which specifies that a given member may be overridden
by a subclass, while others are marked with static (and are therefore called at the class level):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Object
{
    <span class="rem">// Virtual members.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Equals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj);
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Finalize();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetHashCode();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">virtual</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString();

    <span class="rem">// Instance level, non-virtual members.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Type GetType();
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> MemberwiseClone();

    <span class="rem">// Static members.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Equals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> objA, <span class="kwrd">object</span> objB);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> ReferenceEquals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> objA, <span class="kwrd">object</span> objB);
}</pre>
<p>Table 6-1 offers a rundown of the functionality provided by some of the methods you’re most likely
to make use of.</p>

    Equals()
   </td>   
   <td>
    By default, this method returns true only if the items being
compared refer to the exact same item in memory. Thus,
Equals() is used to compare object references, not the state of
the object. Typically, this method is overridden to return true
only if the objects being compared have the same internal state
values (that is, value-based semantics).
Be aware that if you override Equals(), you should also override
GetHashCode(), as these methods are used internally by
Hashtable types to retrieve subobjects from the container.
The ValueType class overrides
this method for all structures, so they work with value-based
comparisons.

    name). This method will often be overridden by a subclass to
    return a tokenized string of name/value pairs that represent the
    object’s internal state, rather than its fully qualified name.

<p>To illustrate some of the default behavior provided by the Object base class, create a new C#
Console Application named ObjectOverrides. Insert a new C# class type that contains the following
empty class definition for a type named Person:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Remember! Person extends Object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Person {}</pre>
<p>Now, update your Main() method to interact with the inherited members of System.Object as
follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with System.Object *****\n"</span>);
        Person p1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person();

        <span class="rem">// Use inherited members of System.Object.</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"ToString: {0}"</span>, p1.ToString());
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Hash code: {0}"</span>, p1.GetHashCode());
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Type: {0}"</span>, p1.GetType());

        <span class="rem">// Make some other references to p1.</span>
        Person p2 = p1;
        <span class="kwrd">object</span> o = p2;

        <span class="rem">// Are the references pointing to the same object in memory?</span>
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (o.Equals(p1) &amp;&amp; p2.Equals(o))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Same instance!"</span>);
        }
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
<p>Here is the output of the current Main() method.</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with System.Object *****

ToString: ObjectOverrides.Person
Hash code: 46104728
Type: ObjectOverrides.Person
Same instance!</pre>
<p>First, notice how the default implementation of ToString() returns the fully qualified name of the
current type (ObjectOverrides.Person). Every C# project defines a “root namespace,” which has the same name of
the project itself. Here, you created a project named ObjectOverrides; thus the Person type (as well as the
Program class) have both been placed within the ObjectOverrides namespace.</p>
<p>The default behavior of Equals() is to test whether two variables are pointing to the same object in
memory. Here, you create a new Person variable named p1. At this point, a new Person object is placed
on the managed heap. p2 is also of type Person. However, you are not creating a new instance, but rather
assigning this variable to reference p1. Therefore, p1 and p2 are both pointing to the same object in
memory, as is the variable o (of type object, which was thrown in for good measure). Given that p1, p2,
and o all point to the same memory location, the equality test succeeds.</p>
<p>Although the canned behavior of System.Object can fit the bill in a number of cases, it is quite
common for your custom types to override some of these inherited methods. To illustrate, update the
Person class to support some properties representing an individual’s first name, last name, and age, each
of which can be set by a custom constructor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Remember! Person extends Object.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Person
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> FirstName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> LastName { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Age { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person(<span class="kwrd">string</span> fName, <span class="kwrd">string</span> lName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> personAge)
    {
        FirstName = fName;
        LastName = lName;
        Age = personAge;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Person(){}
}</pre>
    <h2>Overriding System.Object.ToString()</h2>
  <p>Many classes (and structures) that you create can benefit from overriding ToString() in order to return a
string textual representation of the type’s current state. This can be quite helpful for purposes of
debugging (among other reasons). How you choose to construct this string is a matter of personal
choice; however, a recommended approach is to separate each name/value pair with semicolons and
wrap the entire string within square brackets (many types in the .NET base class libraries follow this
approach). Consider the following overridden ToString() for your Person class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
{
    <span class="kwrd">string</span> myState;
    myState = <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"[First Name: {0}; Last Name: {1}; Age: {2}]"</span>,
        FirstName, LastName, Age);
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> myState;
}</pre>
<p>This implementation of ToString() is quite straightforward, given that the Person class only has
three pieces of state data. However, always remember that a proper ToString() override should also
account for any data defined up the chain of inheritance.</p>
<p>When you override ToString() for a class extending a custom base class, the first order of business is
to obtain the ToString() value from your parent using the base keyword. Once you have obtained your
parent’s string data, you can append the derived class’s custom information.</p>
<h2>Overriding System.Object.Equals()</h2>
  <p>Let’s also override the behavior of Object.Equals() to work with value-based semantics. Recall that by
default, Equals() returns true only if the two objects being compared reference the same object instance
in memory. For the Person class, it may be helpful to implement Equals() to return true if the two
variables being compared contain the same state values (e.g., first name, last name, and age).</p>
<p>First of all, notice that the incoming argument of the Equals() method is a general System. Object.
Given this, your first order of business is to ensure the caller has indeed passed in a Person object, and as
an extra safeguard, to make sure the incoming parameter is not a null reference.</p>
<p>Once you have established the caller has passed you an allocated Person, one approach to
implement Equals() is to perform a field-by-field comparison against the data of the incoming object to
the data of the current object:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Equals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (obj <span class="kwrd">is</span> Person &amp;&amp; obj != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
    {
        Person temp;
        temp = (Person)obj;
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (temp.FirstName == <span class="kwrd">this</span>.FirstName
            &amp;&amp; temp.LastName == <span class="kwrd">this</span>.LastName
            &amp;&amp; temp.Age == <span class="kwrd">this</span>.Age)
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
        }
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">false</span>;
        }
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">false</span>;
}</pre>
<p>Here, you are examining the values of the incoming object against the values of your internal values
(note the use of the this keyword). If the name and age of each are identical, you have two objects with
the exact same state data and therefore return true. Any other possibility results in returning false.</p>
<p>While this approach does indeed work, you can certainly imagine how labor intensive it would be to
implement a custom Equals() method for nontrivial types that may contain dozens of data fields. One
common shortcut is to leverage your own implementation of ToString(). If a class has a prim-andproper
implementation of ToString() that accounts for all field data up the chain of inheritance, you can
simply perform a comparison of the object’s string data:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Equals(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
{
    <span class="rem">// No need to cast 'obj' to a Person anymore,</span>
    <span class="rem">// as everything has a ToString() method.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> obj.ToString() == <span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString();
}</pre>
<p>Notice in this case that we no longer need to check if the incoming argument is of the correct type (a
Person in our example), as everything in .NET supports a ToString() method. Even better, we no longer
need to perform a property-by-property equality check, as we are now simply testing the value returned
from ToString().</p>
<h2>Overriding System.Object.GetHashCode()</h2>
  <p>When a class overrides the Equals() method, you should also override the default implementation of
GetHashCode(). Simply put, a hash code is a numerical value that represents an object as a particular
state. For example, if you create two string variables that hold the value Hello, you would obtain the
same hash code. However, if one of the string objects were in all lowercase (hello), you would obtain
different hash codes.</p>
<p>By default, System.Object.GetHashCode() uses your object’s current location in memory to yield the
hash value. However, if you are building a custom type that you intend to store in a Hashtable type
(within the System.Collections namespace), you should always override this member, as the Hashtable
will be internally invoking Equals() and GetHashCode() to retrieve the correct object.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> To be more specific, the System.Collections.Hashtable class calls GetHashCode() internally to gain an
general idea where the object is located, but a subsequent (internal) call to Equals() determines the exact match.</p>
<p>Although you are not going to place your Person into a System.Collections.Hashtable, for
completion, let’s override GetHashCode(). There are many algorithms that can be used to create a hash
code, some fancy, others not so fancy. Most of the time, you are able to generate a hash code value by
leveraging the System.String’s GetHashCode() implementation.</p>
<p>Given that the String class already has a solid hash code algorithm that is using the character data
of the String to compute a hash value, if you can identify a piece of field data on your class that should
be unique for all instances (such as a Social Security number), simply call GetHashCode() on that point of
field data. Thus, if the Person class defined a SSN property, we could author the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Return a hash code based on a point of unique string data.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetHashCode()
{
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> SSN.GetHashCode();
}</pre>
<p>If you cannot find a single point of unique string data, but you have overridden ToString(), call
GetHashCode() on your own string representation:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Return a hash code based on the person's ToString() value.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> GetHashCode()
{
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">this</span>.ToString().GetHashCode();
}</pre>
<h2>Testing Your Modified Person Class</h2>
<p>Now that you have overridden the virtual members of Object, update Main() to test your updates.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with System.Object *****\n"</span>);
    <span class="rem">// NOTE: We want these to be identical to test</span>
    <span class="rem">// the Equals() and GetHashCode() methods.</span>
    Person p1 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Homer"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 50);
    Person p2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Homer"</span>, <span class="str">"Simpson"</span>, 50);

    <span class="rem">// Get stringified version of objects.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"p1.ToString() = {0}"</span>, p1.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"p2.ToString() = {0}"</span>, p2.ToString());

    <span class="rem">// Test Overridden Equals()</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"p1 = p2?: {0}"</span>, p1.Equals(p2));

    <span class="rem">// Test hash codes.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Same hash codes?: {0}"</span>, p1.GetHashCode() == p2.GetHashCode());
    Console.WriteLine();

    <span class="rem">// Change age of p2 and test again.</span>
    p2.Age = 45;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"p1.ToString() = {0}"</span>, p1.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"p2.ToString() = {0}"</span>, p2.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"p1 = p2?: {0}"</span>, p1.Equals(p2));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Same hash codes?: {0}"</span>, p1.GetHashCode() == p2.GetHashCode());
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
    <p>The output can be seen here:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with System.Object *****

p1.ToString() = [First Name: Homer; Last Name: Simpson; Age: 50]
p2.ToString() = [First Name: Homer; Last Name: Simpson; Age: 50]
p1 = p2?: True
Same hash codes?: True

p1.ToString() = [First Name: Homer; Last Name: Simpson; Age: 50]
p2.ToString() = [First Name: Homer; Last Name: Simpson; Age: 45]
p1 = p2?: False
Same hash codes?: False</pre>
<h2>The Static Members of System.Object</h2>
<p>In addition to the instance-level members you have just examined, System.Object does define two (very
helpful) static members that also test for value-based or reference-based equality. Consider the
following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> StaticMembersOfObject()
{
    <span class="rem">// Static members of System.Object.</span>
    Person p3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Sally"</span>, <span class="str">"Jones"</span>, 4);
    Person p4 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Person(<span class="str">"Sally"</span>, <span class="str">"Jones"</span>, 4);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"P3 and P4 have same state: {0}"</span>, <span class="kwrd">object</span>.Equals(p3, p4));
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"P3 and P4 are pointing to same object: {0}"</span>,
        <span class="kwrd">object</span>.ReferenceEquals(p3, p4));
}</pre>
<p>Here, you are able to simply send in two objects (of any type) and allow the System.Object class to
determine the details automatically. These methods can be very helpful when you have redefined
equality for a custom type, yet still need to quickly determine whether two reference variables point to
the same location in memory (via the static ReferenceEquals() method).</p>
