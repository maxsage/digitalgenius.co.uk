<h1>Understanding the Role of .NET Attributes</h1>
    <p>As illustrated at beginning of this chapter, one role of a .NET compiler is to generate metadata
descriptions for all defined and referenced types. In addition to this standard metadata contained within
any assembly, the .NET platform provides a way for programmers to embed additional metadata into an
assembly using attributes. In a nutshell, attributes are nothing more than code annotations that can be
applied to a given type (class, interface, structure, etc.), member (property, method, etc.), assembly, or
module.</p>
<p>The idea of annotating code using attributes is not new. COM IDL provided numerous predefined
attributes that allowed developers to describe the types contained within a given COM server. However,
COM attributes were little more than a set of keywords. If a COM developer needed to create a custom
attribute, he or she could do so, but it was referenced in code by a 128-bit number (GUID), which was
cumbersome at best.</p>
<p>.NET attributes are class types that extend the abstract System.Attribute base class. As you explore
the .NET namespaces, you will find many predefined attributes that you are able to make use of in your
applications. Furthermore, you are free to build custom attributes to further qualify the behavior of your
types by creating a new type deriving from Attribute.</p>
<p>The .NET base class library provides a number of attributes in various namespaces. Table 15-3 gives
a snapshot of some—but by absolutely no means all—predefined attributes.</p>
<p><b>Table 15-3.</b> A Tiny Sampling of Predefined Attributes</p>
<table class="gridtable"> 
  <tr>
   <th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    [CLSCompliant]
   </td>
   <td>
    Enforces the annotated item to conform to the rules of the Common
Language Specification (CLS). Recall that CLS-compliant types are
guaranteed to be used seamlessly across all .NET programming languages.

   <td>
    [DllImport]
   </td>
   <td>
    Allows .NET code to make calls to any unmanaged C- or C++-based code
library, including the API of the underlying operating system. Do note that
[DllImport] is not used when communicating with COM-based software.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    [Obsolete]
   </td>
   <td>
    Marks a deprecated type or member. If other programmers attempt to use
such an item, they will receive a compiler warning describing the error of
their ways.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    [Serializable]
   </td>
   <td>
    Marks a class or structure as being “serializable,” meaning it is able to
persist its current state into a stream.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    [NonSerialized]
   </td>
   <td>
    Specifies that a given field in a class or structure should not be persisted
during the serialization process.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    [WebMethod]
   </td>
   <td>
    Marks a method as being invokable via HTTP requests and instructs the
CLR to serialize the method return value as XML.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Understand that when you apply attributes in your code, the embedded metadata is essentially
useless until another piece of software explicitly reflects over the information. If this is not the case, the
blurb of metadata embedded within the assembly is ignored and completely harmless.</p>
<h2>Attribute Consumers</h2>
<p>As you would guess, the .NET 4.0 Framework SDK ships with numerous utilities that are indeed on the
lookout for various attributes. The C# compiler (csc.exe) itself has been preprogrammed to discover the
presence of various attributes during the compilation cycle. For example, if the C# compiler encounters
the [CLSCompliant] attribute, it will automatically check the attributed item to ensure it is exposing only
CLS-compliant constructs. By way of another example, if the C# compiler discovers an item attributed
with the [Obsolete] attribute, it will display a compiler warning in the Visual Studio 2010 Error List
window.</p>
<p>In addition to development tools, numerous methods in the .NET base class libraries are
preprogrammed to reflect over specific attributes. For example, if you wish to persist the state of an
object to file, all you are required to do is annotate your class or structure with the [Serializable]
attribute. If the Serialize() method of the BinaryFormatter class encounters this attribute, the object is
automatically persisted to file in a compact binary format.</p>
<p>The .NET CLR is also on the prowl for the presence of certain attributes. One famous .NET attribute
is [WebMethod], used to build XML web services using ASP.NET. If you wish to expose a method via HTTP
requests and automatically encode the method return value as XML, simply apply [WebMethod] to the
method and the CLR handles the details. Beyond web service development, attributes are critical to the
operation of the .NET security system, Windows Communication Foundation, and COM/.NET
interoperability (and so on).</p>
<p>Finally, you are free to build applications that are programmed to reflect over your own custom
attributes as well as any attribute in the .NET base class libraries. By doing so, you are essentially able to
create a set of “keywords” that are understood by a specific set of assemblies.</p>
<h2>Applying Attributes in C#</h2>
<p>To illustrate the process of applying attributes in C#, create a new Console Application named
ApplyingAttributes. Assume you wish to build a class named Motorcycle that can be persisted in a binary
format. To do so, simply apply the [Serializable] attribute to the class definition. If you have a field that
should not be persisted, you may apply the [NonSerialized] attribute:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This class can be saved to disk.</span>
[Serializable]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Motorcycle
{
    <span class="rem">// However this field will not be persisted.</span>
    [NonSerialized]
    <span class="kwrd">float</span> weightOfCurrentPassengers;
    
    <span class="rem">// These fields are still serializable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> hasRadioSystem;
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> hasHeadSet;
    <span class="kwrd">bool</span> hasSissyBar;
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> An attribute applies to the “very next” item. For example, the only nonserialized field of the Motorcycle
class is weightOfCurrentPassengers. The remaining fields are serializable given that the entire class has
been annotated with [Serializable].</p>
<p>At this point, don’t concern yourself with the actual process of object serialization (Chapter 20
examines the details). Just notice that when you wish to apply an attribute, the name of the attribute is
sandwiched between square brackets.</p>
<p>Once this class has been compiled, you can view the extra metadata using ildasm.exe. Notice that
these attributes are recorded using the serializable token (see the red triangle immediately inside the
Motorcycle class) and the notserialized token (on the weightOfCurrentPassengers field; see Figure 15-3).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure15_03.png" alt="Figure 15-3" />
<p><b>Figure 15-3</b> Attributes shown in ildasm.exe</p>
<p>As you might guess, a single item can be attributed with multiple attributes. Assume you have a
legacy C# class type (HorseAndBuggy) that was marked as serializable, but is now considered obsolete for
current development. Rather than deleting the class definition from your code base (and risk breaking
existing software), you can mark the class with the [Obsolete] attribute. To apply multiple attributes to a
single item, simply use a comma-delimited list:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable, Obsolete("Use another vehicle!")]
public class HorseAndBuggy
{
// ...
}</pre>
<p>As an alternative, you can also apply multiple attributes on a single item by stacking each attribute
as follows (the end result is identical):</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
[Serializable]
[Obsolete("Use another vehicle!")]
public class HorseAndBuggy
{
// ...
}</pre>
<h2>C# Attribute Shorthand Notation</h2>
<p>If you were consulting the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation, you may have noticed that the
actual class name of the [Obsolete] attribute is ObsoleteAttribute, not Obsolete. As a naming
convention, all .NET attributes (including custom attributes you may create yourself) are suffixed with
the Attribute token. However, to simplify the process of applying attributes, the C# language does not
require you to type in the Attribute suffix. Given this, the following iteration of the HorseAndBuggy type is
identical to the previous (it just involves a few more keystrokes):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
[SerializableAttribute]
[ObsoleteAttribute(<span class="str">"Use another vehicle!"</span>)]
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> HorseAndBuggy
{
    <span class="rem">// ...</span>
}</pre>
<p>Be aware that this is a courtesy provided by C#. Not all .NET-enabled languages support this
shorthand attribute syntax.</p>
<h2>Specifying Constructor Parameters for Attributes</h2>
<p>Notice that the [Obsolete] attribute is able to accept what appears to be a constructor parameter. If you
view the formal definition of the [Obsolete] attribute using the Code Definition window (which can be
opened using the View menu of Visual Studio 2010), you will find that this class indeed provides a
constructor receiving a System.String:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ObsoleteAttribute : Attribute
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> ObsoleteAttribute(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message, <span class="kwrd">bool</span> error);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> ObsoleteAttribute(<span class="kwrd">string</span> message);
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> ObsoleteAttribute();
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> IsError { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> Message { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>Understand that when you supply constructor parameters to an attribute, the attribute is not
allocated into memory until the parameters are reflected upon by another type or an external tool. The
string data defined at the attribute level is simply stored within the assembly as a blurb of metadata.</p>
<h2>The Obsolete Attribute in Action</h2>
<p>Now that HorseAndBuggy has been marked as obsolete, if you were to allocate an instance of this type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    HorseAndBuggy mule = <span class="kwrd">new</span> HorseAndBuggy();
}</pre>
<p>you would find that the supplied string data is extracted and displayed within the Error List window of
Visual Studio 2010, as well as one the offending line of code when you hover your mouse cursor above
the obsolete type (see Figure 15-4).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure07_01.png" alt="Figure 15-4" />
<p><b>Figure 15-4</b> Attributes in action</p>
<p>In this case, the “other piece of software” that is reflecting on the [Obsolete] attribute is the C#
compiler. Hopefully, at this point, you should understand the following key points regarding .NET
attributes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Attributes are classes that derive from System.Attribute.</li>
 <li>Attributes result in embedded metadata.</li>
 <li>Attributes are basically useless until another agent reflects upon them.</li>
 <li>Attributes are applied in C# using square brackets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up, let’s examine how you can build your own custom attributes and a piece of custom
software that reflects over the embedded metadata.</p>
