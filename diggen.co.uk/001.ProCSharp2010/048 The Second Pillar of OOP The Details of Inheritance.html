<h1>The Second Pillar of OOP: The Details of Inheritance</h1>
<p>Now that you have seen the basic syntax of inheritance, let’s create a more complex example and get to
know the numerous details of building class hierarchies. To do so, you will be reusing the Employee class
you designed in Chapter 5. To begin, create a brand new C# Console Application named Employees</p>
<p>Next, activate the Project &lt; Add Existing Item menu option and navigate to the location of your
Employee.cs and Employee.Internals.cs files you created in the EmployeeApp example of previous
chapter. Select each of them (via a Ctrl-click) and click the Add button. Visual Studio 2010 responds by
copying each file into the current project.</p>
<p>Before you start to build some derived classes, you have one detail to attend to. Because the original
Employee class was created in a project named EmployeeApp, the class has been wrapped within an
identically named .NET namespace. Chapter 14 will examine namespaces in detail; however, for
simplicity, rename the current namespace (in both file locations) to Employees in order to match your
new project name:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Be sure to change the namespace name in both C# files!</span>
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> Employees
{
    <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
    {...}
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> As a sanity check, compile and run your new project by pressing Ctrl+F5. The program will not do
anything at this point; however, this will ensure you do not have any compiler errors.</p>
<p>Your goal is to create a family of classes that model various types of employees in a company.
Assume that you wish to leverage the functionality of the Employee class to create two new classes
(SalesPerson and Manager). The class hierarchy you will be building initially over the next several pages
looks something like what you see in Figure 6-4 (be aware that you will not see individual fields in your
diagram if you make use of C# automatic property syntax).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_04.png" alt="Figure 6-4" />
<p><b>Figure 6-4</b> The initial Employees hierarchy</p>
<p>As illustrated in Figure 6-4, you can see that a SalesPerson “is-a” Employee (as is a Manager).
Remember that under the classical inheritance model, base classes (such as Employee) are used to define
general characteristics that are common to all descendents. Subclasses (such as SalesPerson and
Manager) extend this general functionality while adding more specific functionality.</p>
<p>For your example, you will assume that the Manager class extends Employee by recording the number
of stock options, while the SalesPerson class maintains the number of sales made. Insert a new class file
(Manager.cs) that defines the Manager class with the following automatic property:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Managers need to know their number of stock options.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Manager : Employee
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> StockOptions { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
    <p>Next, add another new class file (SalesPerson.cs) that defines the SalesPerson class with a fitting
automatic property:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Salespeople need to know their number of sales.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> SalesPerson : Employee
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> SalesNumber { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}</pre>
<p>Now that you have established an “is-a” relationship, SalesPerson and Manager have automatically
inherited all public members of the Employee base class. To illustrate, update your Main() method as
follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Create a subclass object and access base class functionality.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** The Employee Class Hierarchy *****\n"</span>);
    SalesPerson danny = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SalesPerson();
    danny.Age = 31;
    danny.Name = <span class="str">"Danny"</span>;
    danny.SalesNumber = 50;
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Controlling Base Class Creation with the base Keyword</h2>
  <p>Currently, SalesPerson and Manager can only be created using the freebee default constructor (see
Chapter 5). With this in mind, assume you have added a new six-argument constructor to the Manager
type, which is invoked as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Assume Manager has a constructor matching this signature:</span>
    <span class="rem">// (string fullName, int age, int empID,</span>
    <span class="rem">// float currPay, string ssn, int numbOfOpts)</span>
    Manager chucky = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Chucky"</span>, 50, 92, 100000,             <span class="str">"333-23-2322"</span>, 9000);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>If you look at the parameter list, you can clearly see that most of these arguments should be stored
in the member variables defined by the Employee base class. To do so, you might implement this custom
constructor on the Manager class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> Manager(<span class="kwrd">string</span> fullName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID,
    <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay, <span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn, <span class="kwrd">int</span> numbOfOpts)
{
    <span class="rem">// This property is defined by the Manager class.</span>
    StockOptions = numbOfOpts;

    <span class="rem">// Assign incoming parameters using the</span>
    <span class="rem">// inherited properties of the parent class.</span>
    ID = empID;
    Age = age;
    Name = fullName;
    Pay = currPay;
    <span class="rem">// OOPS! This would be a compiler error,</span>
    <span class="rem">// if the SSN property were read-only!</span>
    SocialSecurityNumber = ssn;
}</pre>
<p>The first issue with this approach is that if you defined any property as read-only (for example, the
SocialSecurityNumber property), you are unable to assign the incoming string parameter to this field, as
seen in the final code statement of this custom constructor.</p>
<p>The second issue is that you have indirectly created a rather inefficient constructor, given the fact
that under C#, unless you say otherwise, the default constructor of a base class is called automatically
before the logic of the derived constructor is executed. After this point, the current implementation
accesses numerous public properties of the Employee base class to establish its state. Thus, you have
really made seven hits (five inherited properties and two constructor calls) during the creation of a
Manager object!</p>
<p>To help optimize the creation of a derived class, you will do well to implement your subclass
constructors to explicitly call an appropriate custom base class constructor, rather than the default. In
this way, you are able to reduce the number of calls to inherited initialization members (which saves
processing time). Let’s retrofit the custom constructor of the Manager type to do this very thing using the
base keyword:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> Manager(<span class="kwrd">string</span> fullName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID,
    <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay, <span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn, <span class="kwrd">int</span> numbOfOpts)
    : <span class="kwrd">base</span>(fullName, age, empID, currPay, ssn)
{
    <span class="rem">// This property is defined by the Manager class.</span>
    StockOptions = numbOfOpts;
}</pre>
    <p>Here, the base keyword is hanging off the constructor signature (much like the syntax used to chain
constructors on a single class using the this keyword as was discussed in see Chapter 5), which always
indicates a derived constructor is passing data to the immediate parent constructor. In this situation,
you are explicitly calling the five-parameter constructor defined by Employee and saving yourself
unnecessary calls during the creation of the child class. The custom SalesPerson constructor looks
almost identical:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// As a general rule, all subclasses should explicitly call an appropriate</span>
<span class="rem">// base class constructor.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> SalesPerson(<span class="kwrd">string</span> fullName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID,
    <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay, <span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn, <span class="kwrd">int</span> numbOfSales)
    : <span class="kwrd">base</span>(fullName, age, empID, currPay, ssn)
{
    <span class="rem">// This belongs with us!</span>
    SalesNumber = numbOfSales;
}</pre>
<p><b>Note </b>You may use the base keyword anytime a subclass wishes to access a public or protected member
defined by a parent class. Use of this keyword is not limited to constructor logic. You will see examples using base
in this manner during the examination of polymorphism later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Finally, recall that once you add a custom constructor to a class definition, the default constructor is
silently removed. Therefore, be sure to redefine the default constructor for the SalesPerson and Manager
types, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Add back the default ctor</span>
<span class="rem">// in the Manager class as well.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> SalesPerson() {}</pre>
<h2>Keeping Family Secrets: The protected Keyword</h2>
  <p>As you already know, public items are directly accessible from anywhere, while private items can only be
accessed by the class that has defined it. C# takes the lead of many other
modern object languages and provides an additional keyword to define member accessibility: protected.</p>
<p>When a base class defines protected data or protected members, it establishes a set of items that can
be accessed directly by any descendent. If you wish to allow the SalesPerson and Manager child classes to
directly access the data sector defined by Employee, you can update the original Employee class definition
as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// protected state data.</span>
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// Derived classes can now directly access this information.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> empName;
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID;
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay;
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> empAge;
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> empSSN;
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> companyName;
...
}</pre>
<p>The benefit of defining protected members in a base class is that derived types no longer have to
access the data indirectly using public methods or properties. The possible downfall, of course, is that
when a derived type has direct access to its parent’s internal data, it is very possible to accidentally
bypass existing business rules found within public properties. When you define protected members, you
are creating a level of trust between the parent and child class, as the compiler will not catch any
violation of your type’s business rules.</p>
<p>Finally, understand that as far as the object user is concerned, protected data is regarded as private
(as the user is “outside” of the family). Therefore, the following is illegal:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Error! Can't access protected data from object instance.</span>
    Employee emp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Employee();
    emp.empName = <span class="str">"Fred"</span>;
}</pre>
<p>Although protected field data can break encapsulation, it is quite safe (and useful) to define protected
methods. When building class hierarchies, it is very common to define a set of methods that are only for use by
derived types.</p>
<h2>Adding a Sealed Class</h2>
<p>Recall that a sealed class cannot be extended by other classes. As mentioned, this technique is most often
used when you are designing a utility class. However, when building class hierarchies, you might find
that a certain branch in the inheritance chain should be “capped off,” as it makes no sense to further
extend the linage. For example, assume you have added yet another class to your program
(PTSalesPerson) that extends the existing SalesPerson type. Figure 6-5 shows the current update.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure06_05.png" alt="Figure 6-5" />
<p><b>Figure 6-5. </b>The PTSalesPerson class</p>
<p>PTSalesPerson is a class representing, of course, a part-time salesperson. For the sake of argument,
let’s say that you wish to ensure that no other developer is able to subclass from PTSalesPerson. (After all,
how much more part-time can you get than “part-time”?) Again, to prevent others from extending a
class, make use of the sealed keyword:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">sealed</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> PTSalesPerson : SalesPerson
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> PTSalesPerson(<span class="kwrd">string</span> fullName, <span class="kwrd">int</span> age, <span class="kwrd">int</span> empID,
            <span class="kwrd">float</span> currPay, <span class="kwrd">string</span> ssn, <span class="kwrd">int</span> numbOfSales)
        :<span class="kwrd">base</span> (fullName, age, empID, currPay, ssn, numbOfSales)
    {
    }

        <span class="rem">// Assume other members here...</span>
}</pre>
<p>Given that sealed classes cannot be extended, you may wonder if it is possible to reuse the
functionality found within a class marked sealed? Glad you asked! If you wish to build a new class that
leverages the functionality of a sealed class, your one option is to make use of the
containment/delegation model (aka the “has-a” relationship).</p>
