<h1>Rendering Graphical Data Using the Visual Layer</h1>
    <p>The final option for rendering graphical data with WPF is termed the visual layer. As mentioned, you can
only gain access to this layer through code (it is not XAML-friendly). While a vast majority of your WPF
applications will work just fine using shapes, drawings, and geometries, the visual layer does provide the
fastest possible way to render huge amounts of graphical data. Oddly, this very low-level graphical layer
can also be useful when you need render to single image over a very large area. For example, if you need
to fill the background of a window with a plain static image, the visual layer will be the fastest way to do
so, and it may be useful if you need to change between window backgrounds very quickly, based on user
input or whatnot.</p>
<p>While we won’t spend too much time delving into the details of this aspect of WPF programming,
let’s build a small sample program that illustrates the basics.</p>
<h2>The Visual Base Class and Derived Child Classes</h2>
<p>The abstract System.Windows.Media.Visual class type supplies a minimal set of services (rendering, hit
testing, transformations) to render graphics, but it does not provide support for additional non-visual
services, which can lead to code bloat (input events, layout services, styles, and data binding). Notice the
simple inheritance chain of the Visual type, as shown in Figure 29-21.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure29_21.png" alt="Figure 29-21" />
<p><b>Figure 29-21</b> The Visual type provides basic hit testing, coordinate transformation, and bounding box
calculations</p>
<p>Given that Visual is an abstract base class, we need to use one of the derived types to perform actual
rendering operations. WPF provides a handful of subclasses, including DrawingVisual,
Viewport3DVisual, and ContainerVisual.</p>
<p>In this example, we will focus only on DrawingVisual, a lightweight drawing class that is used to
render shapes, images, or text.</p>
<h2>A First Look at using the DrawingVisual Class</h2>
<p>To render data onto a surface using a DrawingVisual, you need to take the following basic steps:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Obtain a DrawingContext object from the DrawingVisual.</li>
  <li>Use the DrawingContext to render the graphical data.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two steps represent the bare minimum necessary for rendering some data to a surface.
However, if you want the graphical data you’ve rendered to be responsive to hit-testing calculations
(which would be important for adding user interactivity), you will also need to perform these additional
steps:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Update the logical and visual trees maintained by the container you are rendering
on top of.</li>
  <li>Override two virtual methods from the FrameworkElement class, allowing the
container to obtain the visual data you have created.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will examine these final two steps in a bit. First, to illustrate how you can use the DrawingVisual
class to render 2D data, create a new WPF application with Visual Studio named RenderingWithVisuals.
Our first goal is to use a DrawingVisual to dynamically assign data to a WPF Image control. Begin by
updating the XAML of your window like so:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Window</span> <span class="attr">x:Class</span><span class="kwrd">="RenderingWithVisuals.MainWindow"</span>

        <span class="attr">xmlns:x</span><span class="kwrd">="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"</span>

        <span class="attr">Loaded</span><span class="kwrd">="Window_Loaded"</span> <span class="attr">WindowStartupLocation</span><span class="kwrd">="CenterScreen"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span> <span class="attr">Background</span><span class="kwrd">="AliceBlue"</span> <span class="attr">Name</span><span class="kwrd">="myStackPanel"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Image</span> <span class="attr">Name</span><span class="kwrd">="myImage"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="80"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">Window</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Notice that our &lt;Image&gt; control does not yet have a Source value, as that will happen at runtime.
Also notice that we are handling the Loaded event of the window, which will do the work of building the
in-memory graphical data, using a DrawingBrush object. Here is the implementation of the Loaded event
handler:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Window_Loaded(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="kwrd">const</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> TextFontSize = 30;

    <span class="rem">// Make a System.Windows.Media.FormattedText object.</span>
    FormattedText text = <span class="kwrd">new</span> FormattedText(<span class="str">"Hello Visual Layer!"</span>,
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> System.Globalization.CultureInfo(<span class="str">"en-us"</span>),
        FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> Typeface(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.FontFamily, FontStyles.Italic,
            FontWeights.DemiBold, FontStretches.UltraExpanded),
        TextFontSize,
        Brushes.Green);

    <span class="rem">// Create a DrawingVisual, and obtain the DrawingContext.</span>
    DrawingVisual drawingVisual = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DrawingVisual();
    <span class="kwrd">using</span>(DrawingContext drawingContext = drawingVisual.RenderOpen())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Now, call any of the methods of DrawingContext to render data.</span>
        drawingContext.DrawRoundedRectangle(Brushes.Yellow, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Pen(Brushes.Black, 5),
            <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rect(5, 5, 450, 100), 20, 20);
        drawingContext.DrawText(text, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(20, 20));
    }

    <span class="rem">// Dynamically make a bitmap, using the data in the DrawingVisual.</span>
    RenderTargetBitmap bmp = <span class="kwrd">new</span> RenderTargetBitmap(500, 100, 100, 90,
        PixelFormats.Pbgra32);
    bmp.Render(drawingVisual);

    <span class="rem">// Set the source of the Image control!</span>
    myImage.Source = bmp;
}</pre>
<p>This code introduces a number of new WPF classes, which I will briefly comment on here (be sure to
check the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation for full details if you are interested). The method
begins by creating a new FormattedText object that represents the textual portion of the in-memory
image we are constructing. As you can see, the constructor allows us to specify numerous attributes such
as font size, font family, foreground color, and the text itself.</p>
<p>Next, we obtain the necessary DrawingContext object via a call to RenderOpen() on the DrawingVisual
instance. Here, we are rendering a colored, rounded rectangle into the DrawingVisual, followed by our
formatted text. In both cases, we are placing the graphical data into the DrawingVisual using hard-coded
values, which is not necessarily a great idea for production, but fine for our simple test.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Be sure to look up the DrawingContext class within the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK documentation to view
all rendering members. If you have worked with the Windows Forms Graphics object in the past, DrawingContext
should look very similar.</p>
<p>The last few statements map the DrawingVisual into a RenderTargetBitmap object, which is a
member of the System.Windows.Media.Imaging namespace. This class will take a visual object, and
transform it into an in-memory bitmap image. After this point, we set the Source property of the Image
control, and sure enough, we see the output in Figure 29-22.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure29_22.png" alt="Figure 29-22" />
<p><b>Figure 29-22</b> Using the visual layer to render an in-memory bitmap</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The System.Windows.Media.Imaging namespace contains a number of additional encoding classes that
let you save the in-memory RenderTargetBitmap object to a physical file in a variety of formats. Check out the
JpegBitmapEncoder class (and friends) for more information.</p>
<h2>Rendering Visual Data to a Custom Layout Manager</h2>
<p>While it is interesting to use DrawingVisual to paint onto the background of a WPF control, it is perhaps
more common to build a custom layout manager (Grid, StackPanel, Canvas, etc) that uses the visual layer
internally to render its content. Once you have created such a custom layout manager, you can plug it
into a normal Window (or Page, or ) and have a part of the UI using a highly optimized
rendering agent, while the non-critical aspects of the hosting Window use shapes and drawings for the
remainder of the graphical data.</p>
<p>If you don’t require the extra functionality provided by a dedicated layout manager, you could opt to
simply extend FrameworkElement, which does have the necessary infrastructure to also contain visual
items. To illustrate how this could be done, insert a new class to your project named
CustomVisualFrameworkElement. Extend this class from FrameworkElement and import the
System.Windows, System.Windows.Input and System.Windows.Media namespaces.</p>
<p>This class will maintain a member variable of type VisualCollection, which contains two fixed
DrawingVisual objects (of course, you could add new members to this collection via a mouse operation,
but this example will keep it simple). Update your class with the following new functionality:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> CustomVisualFrameworkElement : FrameworkElement
{
    <span class="rem">// A collection of all the visuals we are building.</span>
    VisualCollection theVisuals;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> CustomVisualFrameworkElement()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Fill the VisualCollection with a few DrawingVisual objects.</span>
        <span class="rem">// The ctor arg represents the owner of the visuals.</span>
        theVisuals = <span class="kwrd">new</span> VisualCollection(<span class="kwrd">this</span>);
        theVisuals.Add(AddRect());
        theVisuals.Add(AddCircle());
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Visual AddCircle()
    {
        DrawingVisual drawingVisual = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DrawingVisual();
        
        <span class="rem">// Retrieve the DrawingContext in order to create new drawing content.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (DrawingContext drawingContext = drawingVisual.RenderOpen())
        {
            <span class="rem">// Create a circle and draw it in the DrawingContext.</span>
            Rect rect = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rect(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(160, 100), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Size(320, 80));
            drawingContext.DrawEllipse(Brushes.DarkBlue, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(70, 90), 40, 50);
        }
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> drawingVisual;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> Visual AddRect()
    {
        DrawingVisual drawingVisual = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DrawingVisual();
        <span class="kwrd">using</span> (DrawingContext drawingContext = drawingVisual.RenderOpen())
        {
            Rect rect = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rect(<span class="kwrd">new</span> Point(160, 100), <span class="kwrd">new</span> Size(320, 80));
            drawingContext.DrawRectangle(Brushes.Tomato, <span class="kwrd">null</span>, rect);
        }
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> drawingVisual;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Now, before we can use this custom FrameworkElement in our Window, we must override two key
virtual methods mentioned previously, both of which are called internally by WPF during the rendering
process. The GetVisualChild() method returns a child at the specified index from the collection of child
elements. The read-only VisualChildrenCount property returns the number of visual child elements
within this visual collection. Both methods are easy to implement, as we can delegate the real work to
the VisualCollection member variable:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> VisualChildrenCount
{
    <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> theVisuals.Count; }
}

<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> Visual GetVisualChild(<span class="kwrd">int</span> index)
{
    <span class="rem">// Value must be creater than zero, so do a sainity check.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= theVisuals.Count)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">throw</span> <span class="kwrd">new</span> ArgumentOutOfRangeException();
    }
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> theVisuals[index];
}</pre>
<p>We now have just enough functionality to test our custom class. Update the XAML description of the
Window to add one of your CustomVisualFrameworkElement objects to the existing StackPanel. Doing so
will require you to build a custom XML namespace that maps to your .NET namespace (see
Chapter 28):</p>

<p>If all is well, you should see something similar to Figure 29-23 when you run your program.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure29_23.png" alt="Figure 29-23" />
<p><b>Figure 29-23</b> Using the visual layer to render data to a custom FrameworkElement</p>
<h2>Responding to Hit Test Operations</h2>
<p>Because DrawingVisual does not have any of the infrastructure of UIElement or FrameworkElement, you
will need to programmatically add in the ability to calculate hit-test operations. Thankfully, this is fairly
easy to do in the visual layer because of the concept of logical and visual trees. As it turns out, when you
author a blob of XAML, you are essentially building a logical tree of elements. However, behind every
logical tree is a much richer description known as the visual tree, which contains lower-level rendering
instructions.</p>
<p>Chapter 32 will delve into these trees in more detail but for now, just understand that until you
register your custom visuals with these data structures, you will not be able to perform hit-testing
operations. Luckily, the VisualCollection container does this on your behalf (which explains why we
needed to pass in a reference to the custom FrameworkElement as a constructor argument).</p>
<p>First, update the CustomVisualFrameworkElement class to handle the MouseDown event in the class
constructor using standard C# syntax:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">this</span>.MouseDown += MyVisualHost_MouseDown;</pre>
<p>The implementation of this handler will call the VisualTreeHelper.HitTest() method to see if the
mouse is within the boundaries of one of the rendered visuals. To do this, we specify as a parameter to
HitTest(), a HitTestResultCallback delegate that will perform the calculations. If we did click on a
visual, we will toggle between a skewed rendering of the visual and the original rendering. Add the
following methods to your CustomVisualFrameworkElement class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">void</span> MyVisualHost_MouseDown(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="rem">// Figure out where the user clicked.</span>
    Point pt = e.GetPosition((UIElement)sender);

    <span class="rem">// Call helper function via delegate to see if we clicked on a visual.</span>
    VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(<span class="kwrd">this</span>, <span class="kwrd">null</span>,
        <span class="kwrd">new</span> HitTestResultCallback(myCallback), <span class="kwrd">new</span> PointHitTestParameters(pt));
}

<span class="kwrd">public</span> HitTestResultBehavior myCallback(HitTestResult result)
{
    <span class="rem">// Toggle between a skewed rendering and normal rendering,</span>
    <span class="rem">// if a visual was clicked.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (result.VisualHit.GetType() == <span class="kwrd">typeof</span>(DrawingVisual))
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (((DrawingVisual)result.VisualHit).Transform == <span class="kwrd">null</span>)
        {
            ((DrawingVisual)result.VisualHit).Transform = <span class="kwrd">new</span> SkewTransform(7, 7);
        }
        <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        {
            ((DrawingVisual)result.VisualHit).Transform = <span class="kwrd">null</span>;
        }
    }
    
    <span class="rem">// Tell HitTest() to stop drilling into the visual tree.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> HitTestResultBehavior.Stop;
}</pre>
<p>Now, run your program once again. You should now be able to click on either rendered visual and
see the transformation in action! While this is just a very simple example of working with the visual layer
of WPF, remember that you make use of the same brushes, transformations, pens, and layout managers
as you would when working with XAML. As a result, you already know quite a bit about working this
Visual derived classes.</p>
<p><b>Source Code</b> The RenderingWithVisuals project can be found under the Chapter 29 subdirectory.</p>
<p>That wraps up our investigation of the graphical rendering services of Windows Presentation
Foundation. While we covered a number of interesting topics, the reality is that we have only scratched
the surface of WPF’s graphical capabilities. I will leave it in your hands to dig deeper into the topics of
shapes, drawings, brushes, transformations, and visuals (and, to be sure, you will see some additional
details of these topics in the remaining WPF chapters).</p>
