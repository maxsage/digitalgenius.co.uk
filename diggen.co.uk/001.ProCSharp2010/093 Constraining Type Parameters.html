<h1>Constraining Type Parameters</h1>
<p>As this chapter illustrates, any generic item has at least one type parameter that you need to specify at
the time you interact with the generic type or member. This alone allows you to build some type safe
code; however, the .NET platform allows you to use the where keyword to get extremely specific about
what a given type parameter must look like.</p>
<p>Using this keyword, you can add a set of constraints to a given type parameter, which the C# compiler
will check at compile time. Specifically, you can constrain a type parameter as described in Table 10-6.</p>
<p><b>Table 10-6.</b> Possible Constraints for Generic Type Parameters</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Generic Constraint
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    where T : struct
   </td>
   <td>
    The type parameter &lt;T&gt; must have System.ValueType in its chain
     of inheritance; in other words, &lt;T&gt; must be a structure.
   </td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    where T : class
   </td>
   <td>
    The type parameter &lt;T&gt; must not have System.ValueType in its
chain of inheritance (e.g., &lt;T&gt; must be a reference type).
   </td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    where T : new()
   </td>
   <td>
    The type parameter &lt;T&gt; must have a default constructor. This is
helpful if your generic type must create an instance of the type
parameter because you cannot assume you know the format of
custom constructors. Note that this constraint must be listed last
on a multiconstrained type.
   </td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    where T : NameOfBaseClass
   </td>
   <td>
    The type parameter &lt;T&gt; must be derived from the class specified
by NameOfBaseClass.
   </td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    where T : NameOfInterface
   </td>
   <td>
    The type parameter &lt;T&gt; must implement the interface specified
by NameOfInterface. You can separate multiple interfaces as a
comma-delimited list.
   </td>   
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Unless you need to build some extremely type safe custom collections, you might never need to use
the where keyword in your C# projects. </p>
<h2>Examples Using the where Keyword</h2>
<p>Begin by assuming that you have created a custom generic class, and you want to ensure that the type
parameter has a default constructor. This could be useful when the custom generic class needs to create
instances of the T because the default constructor is the only constructor that is potentially common to
all types. Also, constraining T in this way lets you get compile-time checking; if T is a reference type, then
programmer remembered to redefine the default in the class definition (you might recall that the default
constructor is removed in classes when you define your own):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// MyGenericClass derives from object, while</span>
<span class="rem">// contained items must have a default ctor.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyGenericClass&lt;T&gt; where T : <span class="kwrd">new</span>()
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>Notice that the where clause specifies which type parameter is being constrained, followed by a
colon operator. After the colon operator, you list each possible constraint (in this case, a default
constructor). Here is another example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// MyGenericClass derives from object, while</span>
<span class="rem">// contained items must be a class implementing IDrawable</span>
<span class="rem">// and must support a default ctor.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyGenericClass&lt;T&gt; where T : <span class="kwrd">class</span>, IDrawable, <span class="kwrd">new</span>()
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>In this case, T has three requirements. It must be a reference type (not a structure), as marked with
the class token. Second, T must implement the IDrawable interface. Third, it must also have a default
constructor. Multiple constraints are listed in a comma-delimited list; however, you should be aware
that the new() constraint must always be listed last! Thus, the following code will not compile:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Error! new() constraint must be listed last!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyGenericClass&lt;T&gt; where T : <span class="kwrd">new</span>(), <span class="kwrd">class</span>, IDrawable
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>If you ever create a custom generic collection class that specifies multiple type parameters, you can
specify a unique set of constraints for each, using separate where clauses:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// &lt;K&gt; must extend SomeBaseClass and have a default ctor,</span>
<span class="rem">// while &lt;T&gt; must be a structure and implement the</span>
<span class="rem">// generic IComparable interface.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyGenericClass&lt;K, T&gt; where K : SomeBaseClass, <span class="kwrd">new</span>()
    where T : <span class="kwrd">struct</span>, IComparable&lt;T&gt;
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>
You will rarely encounter cases where you need to build a complete custom generic collection class;
however, you can use the where keyword on generic methods, as well. For example, if you want to specify that
your generic Swap&lt;T&gt;() method can only operate on structures, you would update the method like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This method will swap any structure, but not classes.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Swap&lt;T&gt;(<span class="kwrd">ref</span> T a, <span class="kwrd">ref</span> T b) where T : <span class="kwrd">struct</span>
{
    ...
}</pre>
<p>Note that if you were to constrain the Swap() method in this manner, you would no longer be able to
swap string objects (as is shown in the sample code) because string is a reference type.</p>
<h2>The Lack of Operator Constraints</h2>
<p>I want to make one more comment on generic methods and constraints as this chapter draws to a close.
When you create generic methods, it might come as a surprise to you that it causes a compiler error if
you apply any C# operators (+, -, *, ==, etc.) on the type parameters. For example, imagine the usefulness
of a class that can Add(), Subtract(), Multiply(), and Divide() generic types:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Compiler error! Cannot apply</span>
<span class="rem">// operators to type parameters!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BasicMath&lt;T&gt;
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Add(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 + arg2; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Subtract(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 - arg2; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Multiply(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 * arg2; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Divide(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 / arg2; }
}</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the preceding BasicMath class will not compile. While this might seem like a major
restriction, you need to remember that generics are generic. Of course, the numerical data can work just
fine with the binary operators of C#. However, for the sake of argument, if &lt;T&gt; were a custom class or
structure type, the compiler could assume the class supports the +, -, *, and / operators. Ideally, C#
would allow a generic type to be constrained by supported operators, as in this example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Illustrative code only!</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BasicMath&lt;T&gt; where T : <span class="kwrd">operator</span> +, <span class="kwrd">operator</span> -,
    <span class="kwrd">operator</span> *, <span class="kwrd">operator</span> /
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Add(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 + arg2; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Subtract(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 - arg2; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Multiply(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 * arg2; }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> T Divide(T arg1, T arg2)
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> arg1 / arg2; }
}</pre>
<p>Alas, operator constraints are not supported under the current version of C#. However, it is possible
(albeit it requires a bit more work) to achieve the desired effect by defining an interface that supports
these operators (C# interfaces can define operators!) and then specify an interface constraint of the
generic class. In any case, this wraps up this book’s initial look at building custom generic types. In the
next chapter, you will pick up the topic of generics once again in the course of examining the .NET
delegate type.</p>
