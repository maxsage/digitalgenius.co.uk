<h1>LINQ Specific Programming Constructs</h1>
  <p>From a very high level, LINQ can be understood as a strongly typed query language, embedded directly
into the grammar of C# itself. Using LINQ, you can build any number of expressions which have a lookand-
feel similar to that of a database SQL query. However, a LINQ query can be applied to any number
of data stores, including stores that have nothing to do with a literal relational database.</p>
<p><b>Note </b>Although LINQ queries look similar to SQL queries, the syntax is not identical. In fact, many LINQ queries
seem to be the exact opposite format of a similar database query! If you attempt to map LINQ directly to SQL, you
will surely become frustrated. To keep your sanity, I’d recommend that you try your best to regard LINQ queries as
unique entities, which just “happen to look” similar to SQL.</p>
<p>When LINQ was first introduced to the .NET platform in version 3.5, the C# (and VB) languages were
each expanded with a large number of new programming constructs used to support the LINQ
technology set. Specifically, the C# language uses the following core LINQ-centric features:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Implicitly typed local variables</li>
 <li>Object/collection initialization syntax</li>
 <li>Lambda expressions</li>
 <li>Extension methods</li>
 <li>Anonymous types</li>
</ul>
<p>These features have already been explored in detail within various chapters of the text. However, to
get the ball rolling, let’s quickly review each feature in turn, just to make sure we are all in the proper
mindset.</p>
<h2>Implicit Typing of Local Variables</h2>
  <p>In Chapter 3, you learned about the var keyword of C#. This keyword allows you to define a local variable
without explicitly specifying the underlying data type. The variable, however, is strongly typed as the
compiler will determine the correct data type based on the initial assignment. Recall the following code
example from Chapter 3:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DeclareImplicitVars()
{
    <span class="rem">// Implicitly typed local variables.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myInt = 0;
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myBool = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myString = <span class="str">"Time, marches on..."</span>;

    <span class="rem">// Print out the underlying type.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myInt is a: {0}"</span>, myInt.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myBool is a: {0}"</span>, myBool.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"myString is a: {0}"</span>, myString.GetType().Name);
}</pre>
<p>This language feature is very helpful, and often mandatory, when using LINQ. As you will see during
this chapter, many LINQ queries will return a sequence of data types which are not known until compile
time. Given that the underlying data type is not known until the application is compiled, you obviously
can’t declare a variable explicitly!</p>
<h2>Object and Collection Initialization Syntax</h2>
  <p>Chapter 5 explored the role of object initialization syntax, which allows you to create a class or structure
variable, and set any number of its public properties, in one fell swoop. The end result is a very compact
(yet still easy on the eyes) syntax which can be used to get your objects ready for use. Also recall from
Chapter 10, the C# language allows you to use a very similar syntax to initialize collections of objects.
Consider the following code snippet which uses collection initialization syntax to fill a List&lt;T&gt; of
Rectangle objects, each of which maintains two Point objects to represent an (x,y) position:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
List&lt;Rectangle&gt; myListOfRects = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;Rectangle&gt;
{
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle {TopLeft = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point { X = 10, Y = 10 },
        BottomRight = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point { X = 200, Y = 200}},
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle {TopLeft = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point { X = 2, Y = 2 },
        BottomRight = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point { X = 100, Y = 100}},
    <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle {TopLeft = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point { X = 5, Y = 5 },
        BottomRight = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Point { X = 90, Y = 75}}
};</pre>
<p>While you are never required to use collection/object initialization syntax, you do end up with a
more compact code base. Furthermore, this syntax, when combined with implicit typing of local
variables, allows you to declare an anonymous type, which is very useful when creating a LINQ
projection. You’ll learn about LINQ projections later in this chapter.</p>
<h2>Lambda Expressions</h2>
  <p>The C# lambda operator (=&gt;) was fully explored in Chapter 11. Recall that this operator allows us to build
a lambda expression, which can be used any time you invoke a method that requires a strongly typed
delegate as an argument. Lambdas greatly simplify how you work with .NET delegates, in that they
reduce the amount of code you have to author by hand. Recall that a lambda expression can be broken
down into the following usage:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
ArgumentsToProcess =&gt; StatementsToProcessThem</pre>
<p>In Chapter 11, I walked you through how to interact with the FindAll() method of the generic
List&lt;T&gt; class using three different approaches. After working with the raw Predicate&lt;T&gt; delegate and a
C# anonymous method, you eventually arrived with the following (extremely concise) iteration which
used the following lambda expression:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> LambdaExpressionSyntax()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make a list of integers.</span>
    List&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt; list = <span class="kwrd">new</span> List&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt;();
    list.AddRange(<span class="kwrd">new</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span>[] { 20, 1, 4, 8, 9, 44 });

    <span class="rem">// C# lambda expression.</span>
    List&lt;<span class="kwrd">int</span>&gt; evenNumbers = list.FindAll(i =&gt; (i % 2) == 0);

    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Here are your even numbers:"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> evenNumber <span class="kwrd">in</span> evenNumbers)
    {
        Console.Write(<span class="str">"{0}\t"</span>, evenNumber);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>Lambdas will be very useful when working with the underlying object model of LINQ. As you will
soon find out, the C# LINQ query operators are simply a shorthand notation for calling true-blue
methods on a class named System.Linq.Enumerable. These methods typically always require delegates
(the Func&lt;&gt; delegate in particular) as parameters, which are used to process your data to yield the correct
result set. Using lambdas, you can streamline your code, and allow the compiler to infer the underlying
delegate.</p>
<h2>Extension Methods</h2>
  <p>C# extension methods allow you to tack on new functionality to existing classes without the need to
subclass. As well, extension methods allow you to add new functionality to sealed classes and structures,
which could never be subclassed in the first place. Recall from Chapter 12, when you author an
extension method, the first parameter is qualified with the this operator, and marks the type being
extended. Also recall that extension methods must always be defined within a static class, and must
therefore also be declared using the static keyword. For an example, see the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> MyExtensions
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> ObjectExtensions
    {
        <span class="rem">// Define an extension method to System.Object.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DisplayDefiningAssembly(<span class="kwrd">this</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"{0} lives here:\n\t-&gt;{1}\n"</span>, obj.GetType().Name,
                Assembly.GetAssembly(obj.GetType()));
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>To use this extension, an application must first set a reference to the external assembly that contains
the extension method implementation using the Add Reference dialog of Visual Studio 2010. At this
point, simply import the defining namespace, and code away:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Since everything extends System.Object, all classes and structures</span>
    <span class="rem">// can use this extension.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> myInt = 12345678;
    myInt.DisplayDefiningAssembly();

    System.Data.DataSet d = <span class="kwrd">new</span> System.Data.DataSet();
    d.DisplayDefiningAssembly();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>When you working with LINQ, you will seldom, if ever, be required to manually build your own
extension methods. However, as you create LINQ query expressions, you will in fact be making use of
numerous extension methods already defined by Microsoft. In fact, each C# LINQ query operator is a
shorthand notation for making a manual call on an underlying extension method, typically defined by
the System.Linq.Enumerable utility class.</p>
<h2>Anonymous Types</h2>
  <p>The final C# language feature I’d like to quickly review is that of anonymous types which was fully
explored in Chapter 12. This feature can be used to quickly model the “shape” of data, by allowing the
compiler to generate a new class definition at compile time, based on a supplied set of name/value
pairs. Recall that this type will be composed using value based semantics, and each virtual method of
System.Object will be overridden accordingly. To define an anonymous type, declare an implicitly typed
variable and specify the data’s shape using object initialization syntax:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Make an anonymous type that is composed of another.</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> purchaseItem = <span class="kwrd">new</span> {
    TimeBought = DateTime.Now,
    ItemBought = <span class="kwrd">new</span> {Color = <span class="str">"Red"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>, CurrentSpeed = 55},
    Price = 34.000};</pre>
 <p>LINQ makes frequent use of anonymous types when you wish to project new forms of data on the
fly. For example, assume you have a collection of Person objects, and wish to use LINQ to obtain
information on the age and social security number of each. Using a LINQ projection, you can allow the
compiler to generate a new anonymous type that contains your information.</p>
