<h1>Understanding the Role of ASP.NET View State</h1>
    <p>The term view state has been thrown out a few times here and in the previous two chapters without a
formal definition, so let’s demystify this term once and for all. Under classic (COM-based) ASP, web
developers were required to manually repopulate the values of the incoming form widgets during the
process of constructing the outgoing HTTP response. For example, if the incoming HTTP request
contained five text boxes with specific values, the *.asp file required script code to extract the current
values (via the Form or QueryString collections of the Request object) and manually place them back into
the HTTP response stream. Needless to say, this was a drag. If the developer failed to do so, the caller
was presented with a set of five empty text boxes!</p>
<p>Under ASP.NET, we no longer have to manually scrape out and repopulate the values in the HTML
widgets because the ASP.NET runtime automatically embeds a hidden form field (named __VIEWSTATE),
which will flow between the browser and a specific page. The data assigned to this field is a Base64-
encoded string that contains a set of name/value pairs representing the values of each GUI widget on the
page at hand.</p>
<p>The System.Web.UI.Page base class’s Init event handler is the entity in charge of reading the
incoming values in the __VIEWSTATE field to populate the appropriate member variables in the derived
class. (This is why it is risky at best to access the state of a web widget within the scope of a page’s Init
event handler.)</p>
<p>Also, just before the outgoing response is emitted back to the requesting browser, the __VIEWSTATE
data is used to repopulate the form’s widgets. Clearly, the best thing about this aspect of ASP.NET is that
it just happens without any work on your part. Of course, you are always able to interact with, alter, or
disable this default functionality if you so choose. To understand how to do this, let’s see a concrete view
state example.</p>
<h2>Demonstrating View State</h2>
<p>First, create a new Empty Web Site called ViewStateApp and insert a new Web Form. On your .aspx
page, add a single ASP.NET ListBox web control named myListBox and a single Button control named
btnPostback. Handle the Click event for the Button to provide a way for the user to post back to the web
server:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> _Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }

    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnPostback_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="rem">// No-op. This is just here to allow a postback.</span>
    }    
}</pre>
<p>Now, using the Visual Studio 2010 Properties window, access the Items property and add four
ListItems to the ListBox using the associated dialog box. The resulting markup looks like this:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListBox</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="myListBox"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Item One<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Item Two<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Item Three<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>Item Four<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListBox</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Note that you are hard-coding the items in the ListBox directly within the *.aspx file. As you already
know, all &lt;asp:&gt; definitions in an HTML form will automatically render back their HTML representation
before the final HTTP response (provided they have the runat="server" attribute).</p>
<p>The &lt;%@Page%&gt; directive has an optional attribute called EnableViewState that by default is set to
true. To disable this behavior, simply update the &lt;%@Page%&gt; directive as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="asp">&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true"
    CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="_Default"
    EnableViewState ="false" %&gt;</span></pre>
 <p>So, what exactly does it mean to disable view state? The answer is, it depends. Given the previous
definition of the term, you would think that if you disable view state for an *.aspx file, the values in your
ListBox would not be remembered between postbacks to the web server. However, if you were to run
this application as is, you might be surprised to find that the information in the ListBox is retained
regardless of how many times you post back to the page.</p>
<p>In fact, if you examine the source HTML returned to the browser (by right-clicking the page within
the browser and selecting View Source), you may be further surprised to see that the hidden __VIEWSTATE
field is still present:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">input</span> <span class="attr">type</span><span class="kwrd">="hidden"</span> <span class="attr">name</span><span class="kwrd">="__VIEWSTATE"</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="__VIEWSTATE"</span>
<span class="attr">value</span><span class="kwrd">="/wEPDwUKLTM4MTM2MDM4NGRkqGC6gjEV25JnddkJiRmoIc10SIA="</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>However, assume that your ListBox is dynamically populated within the code-behind file rather
than within the HTML &lt;form&gt; definition. First, remove the &lt;asp:ListItem&gt; declarations from the current
*.aspx file:</p> 
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:ListBox</span> <span class="attr">ID</span><span class="kwrd">="myListBox"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:ListBox</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Next, fill the list items within the Load event handler in your code-behind file:</p>
<p>CODE GOES HERE</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Page_Load(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (!IsPostBack)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Fill ListBox dynamically!</span>
        myListBox.Items.Add(<span class="str">"Item One"</span>);
        myListBox.Items.Add(<span class="str">"Item Two"</span>);
        myListBox.Items.Add(<span class="str">"Item Three"</span>);
        myListBox.Items.Add(<span class="str">"Item Four"</span>);
    }
}</pre>
<p>If you post to this updated page, you’ll find that the first time the browser requests the page, the
values in the ListBox are present and accounted for. However, on postback, the ListBox is suddenly
empty. The first rule of ASP.NET view state is that its effect is only realized when you have widgets whose
values are dynamically generated through code. If you hard-code values within the *.aspx file’s &lt;form&gt;
tags, the state of these items is always remembered across postbacks (even when you set
EnableViewState to false for a given page).</p>
<p>If the idea of disabling view state for the entire *.aspx file seems a bit too aggressive, know that every
descendent of the System.Web.UI.Control base class inherits the EnableViewState property, which makes
it very simple to disable view state on a control-by-control basis:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">asp:GridView</span> <span class="attr">id</span><span class="kwrd">="myHugeDynamicallyFilledGridOfData"</span> <span class="attr">runat</span><span class="kwrd">="server"</span>
    <span class="attr">EnableViewState</span><span class="kwrd">="false"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">asp:GridView</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
<p><b>Note</b> Under .NET 4.0, large view state data values are automatically compressed, to help reduce the size of this hidden
form field.</p>
<h2>Adding Custom View State Data</h2>
<p>In addition to the EnableViewState property, the System.Web.UI.Control base class provides a protected
property named ViewState. Under the hood, this property provides access to a System.Web.UI.StateBag
type, which represents all the data contained within the __VIEWSTATE field. Using the indexer of the
StateBag type, you can embed custom information within the hidden __VIEWSTATE form field using a set
of name/value pairs. Here’s a simple example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">protected</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnAddToVS_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, EventArgs e)
{
    ViewState[<span class="str">"CustomViewStateItem"</span>] = <span class="str">"Some user data"</span>;
    lblVSValue.Text = (<span class="kwrd">string</span>)ViewState[<span class="str">"CustomViewStateItem"</span>];
}</pre>
    <p>Because the System.Web.UI.StateBag type has been designed to operate on System.Object types,
when you wish to access the value of a given key, you should explicitly cast it into the correct underlying
data type (in this case, a System.String). Be aware, however, that values placed within the __VIEWSTATE
field cannot literally be any object. Specifically, the only valid types are Strings, Integers, Booleans,
ArrayLists, Hashtables, or an array of these types.</p>
<p>So, given that .aspx pages can insert custom bits of information into the __VIEWSTATE string, the next
logical question is when you would want to do so. Most of the time, custom view-state data is best suited
for user-specific preferences. For example, you may establish view-state data that specifies how a user
wishes to view the UI of a GridView (such as a sort order). However, view-state data is not well-suited for
full-blown user data, such as items in a shopping cart or cached DataSets. When you need to store this
sort of complex information, you must work with session or application data. Before we get to that point,
though, you need to understand the role of the Global.asax Global.asax file.</p>
