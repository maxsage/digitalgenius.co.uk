<h1>Understanding Anonymous Types</h1>
  <p>As an OO programmer, you know the benefits of defining classes to represent the state and functionality
of a given programming entity. To be sure, whenever you need to define a class that is intended to be
reused across projects and provides numerous bits of functionality through a set of methods, events,
properties, and custom constructors, creating a new C# class is common practice and often mandatory.</p>
<p>However, there are other times when you would like to define a class simply to model a set of
encapsulated (and somehow related) data points without any associated methods, events, or other
custom functionality. Furthermore, what if this type is only to be used internally to your current
application and it’s not intended to be reused? If you need such a “temporary” type, earlier versions of
C# would require you to nevertheless build a new class definition by hand:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">internal</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> SomeClass
{
    <span class="rem">// Define a set of private member variables...</span>

    <span class="rem">// Make a property for each member variable...</span>

    <span class="rem">// Override ToString() to account for each member variable...</span>

    <span class="rem">// Override GetHashCode() and Equals() to work with value based equality...</span>
}</pre>
<p>While building such a class is not rocket science, it can be rather labor-intensive if you are
attempting to encapsulate more than a handful of members (although automatic properties do help in
this regard). These days, we are provided with a massive shortcut for this very situation (termed
anonymous types) that in many ways is a natural extension of C#’s anonymous methods syntax
(examined in Chapter 11).</p>
<p>When you define an anonymous type, you do so by making use of the var keyword (see Chapter 3)
in conjunction with object initialization syntax (see Chapter 5). To illustrate, create a new Console
Application named AnonymousTypes. Now, update Main() with the following anonymous class, which
models a simple car type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Anonymous Types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make an anonymous type representing a car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> { Color = <span class="str">"Bright Pink"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>, CurrentSpeed = 55 };

    <span class="rem">// Now show the color and make.</span>
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"My car is a {0} {1}."</span>, myCar.Color, myCar.Make);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Again note that the myCar variable must be implicitly typed, which makes good sense as we are not
modeling the concept of an automobile using a strongly typed class definition. At compile time, the C#
compiler will autogenerate a uniquely named class on our behalf. Given the fact that this class name is
not visible from C#, the use of implicit typing using the var keyword is mandatory.</p>
<p>Also notice that we have to specify (using object initialization syntax) the set of properties that
model the data we are attempting to encapsulate. Once defined, these values can then be obtained using
standard C# property invocation syntax.</p>
<h2>The Internal Representation of Anonymous Types</h2>
  <p>All anonymous types are automatically derived from System.Object, and therefore support each of the
members provided by this base class. Given this, we could invoke ToString(), GetHashCode(), Equals(),
or GetType() on the implicitly typed myCar object. Assume our Program class defines the following static
helper function:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ReflectOverAnonymousType(<span class="kwrd">object</span> obj)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"obj is an instance of: {0}"</span>, obj.GetType().Name);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Base class of {0} is {1}"</span>,
        obj.GetType().Name,
        obj.GetType().BaseType);
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"obj.ToString() = {0}"</span>, obj.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"obj.GetHashCode() = {0}"</span>, obj.GetHashCode());
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>Now assume we invoke this method from Main(), passing in the myCar object as the parameter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Anonymous types *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make an anonymous type representing a car.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> myCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> {Color = <span class="str">"Bright Pink"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>, CurrentSpeed = 55};

    <span class="rem">// Reflect over what the compiler generated.</span>
    ReflectOverAnonymousType(myCar);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>The output will look similar to the following:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">
***** Fun with Anonymous types *****

obj is an instance of: &lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0`3
Base class of &lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0`3 is System.Object
obj.ToString() = { Color = Bright Pink, Make = Saab, CurrentSpeed = 55 }
obj.GetHashCode() = 2038548792</pre>
<p>First of all, notice that in this example, the myCar object is of type &lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0`3 (your name
may differ). Remember that the assigned type name is completely determined by the compiler and is not
directly accessible in your C# code base.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, notice that each name/value pair defined using the object initialization
syntax is mapped to an identically named read-only property and a corresponding private read-only
backing field. The following C# code approximates the compiler-generated class used to represent the
myCar object (which again can be verified using tools such as reflector.exe or ildasm.exe):</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> &lt;Make&gt;j__TPar Make { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; }
}</pre>
<h2>The Implementation of ToString() and GetHashCode()</h2>
  <p>All anonymous types automatically derive from System.Object and are provided with an overridden
version of Equals(), GetHashCode(), and ToString(). The ToString() implementation simply builds a
string from each name/value pair, for example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
{
    StringBuilder builder = <span class="kwrd">new</span> StringBuilder();
    builder.Append(<span class="str">"{ Color = "</span>);
    builder.Append(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.&lt;Color&gt;i__Field);
    builder.Append(<span class="str">", Make = "</span>);
    builder.Append(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.&lt;Make&gt;i__Field);
    builder.Append(<span class="str">", CurrentSpeed = "</span>);
    builder.Append(<span class="kwrd">this</span>.&lt;CurrentSpeed&gt;i__Field);
    builder.Append(<span class="str">" }"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">return</span> builder.ToString();
}</pre>
<p>The GetHashCode() implementation computes a hash value using each anonymous type’s member
variables as input to the System.Collections.Generic.EqualityComparer&lt;T&gt; type. Using this
implementation of GetHashCode(), two anonymous types will yield the same hash value if (and only if)
they have the same set of properties that have been assigned the same values. Given this
implementation, anonymous types are well-suited to be contained within a Hashtable container.</p>
<h2>The Semantics of Equality for Anonymous Types</h2>
  <p>While the implementation of the overridden ToString() and GetHashCode() methods is fairly
straightforward, you may be wondering how the Equals() method has been implemented. For example,
if we were to define two "anonymous cars" variables that specify the same name/value pairs, would
these two variables be considered equal or not? To see the results firsthand, update your Program type
with the following new method:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> EqualityTest()
{
    <span class="rem">// Make 2 anonymous classes with identical name/value pairs.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> firstCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> { Color = <span class="str">"Bright Pink"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>, CurrentSpeed = 55 };
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> secondCar = <span class="kwrd">new</span> { Color = <span class="str">"Bright Pink"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>, CurrentSpeed = 55 };

    <span class="rem">// Are they considered equal when using Equals()?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (firstCar.Equals(secondCar))
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Same anonymous object!"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Not the same anonymous object!"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Are they considered equal when using ==?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (firstCar == secondCar)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Same anonymous object!"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Not the same anonymous object!"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Are these objects the same underlying type?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (firstCar.GetType().Name == secondCar.GetType().Name)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"We are both the same type!"</span>);
    <span class="kwrd">else</span>
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"We are different types!"</span>);
    
    <span class="rem">// Show all the details.</span>
    Console.WriteLine();
    ReflectOverAnonymousType(firstCar);
    ReflectOverAnonymousType(secondCar);
}</pre>
<p>Assuming you have called this method from within Main(), Figure 12-6 shows the (somewhat
surprising) output.</p>
<img src="../Images/Figure12_06.png" alt="Figure 12-6" />
<p><b>Figure 12-6. </b>The equality of anonymous types</p>
<p>When you run this test code, you will see that the first conditional test where you call Equals()
returns true, and therefore the message “Same anonymous object!” prints out to the screen. This is
because the compiler-generated Equals() method makes use of value-based semantics when testing for
equality (e.g., checking the value of each field of the objects being compared).</p>
<p>However, the second conditional test (which makes use of the C# equality operator, ==) prints out
"Not the same anonymous object!", which may seem at first glance to be a bit counterintuitive. This
result is due to the fact that anonymous types do not receive overloaded versions of the C# equality
operators (== and !=). Given this, when you test for equality of anonymous types using the C# equality
operators (rather than the Equals() method), the references, not the values maintained by the objects,
are being tested for equality.</p>
<p>Last but not least, in our final conditional test (where we examine the underlying type name), we
find that the anonymous types are instances of the same compiler-generated class type (in this example,
&lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0`3), due to the fact that firstCar and secondCar have the same properties (Color,
Make, and CurrentSpeed).</p>
<p>This illustrates an important but subtle point: the compiler will only generate a new class definition
when an anonymous type contains unique names of the anonymous type. Thus, if you declare identical
anonymous types (again, meaning the same names) within the same assembly, the compiler generates
only a single anonymous type definition.</p>
<h2>Anonymous Types Containing Anonymous Types</h2>
  <p>It is possible to create an anonymous type that is composed of other anonymous types. For example,
assume you wish to model a purchase order that consists of a timestamp, a price point, and the
automobile purchased. Here is a new (slightly more sophisticated) anonymous type representing such
an entity:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Make an anonymous type that is composed of another.</span>
<span class="kwrd">var</span> purchaseItem = <span class="kwrd">new</span> {
    TimeBought = DateTime.Now,
    ItemBought = <span class="kwrd">new</span> {Color = <span class="str">"Red"</span>, Make = <span class="str">"Saab"</span>, CurrentSpeed = 55},
    Price = 34.000};

ReflectOverAnonymousType(purchaseItem);</pre>
 <p>At this point, you should understand the syntax used to define anonymous types, but you may still
be wondering exactly where (and when) to use this new language feature. To be blunt, anonymous type
declarations should be used sparingly, typically only when making use of the LINQ technology set (see
Chapter 14). You would never want to abandon the use of strongly typed classes/structures simply for
the sake of doing so, given anonymous types’ numerous limitations, which include the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You don’t control the name of the anonymous type.</li>
 <li>Anonymous types always extend System.Object.</li>
 <li>The fields and properties of an anonymous type are always read-only.</li>
 <li>Anonymous types cannot support events, custom methods, custom operators, or
custom overrides.</li>
 <li>Anonymous types are always implicitly sealed.</li>
 <li>Anonymous types are always created using the default constructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when programming with the LINQ technology set, you will find that in many cases this
syntax can be very helpful when you want to quickly model the overall shape of an entity rather than its
functionality.</p>
