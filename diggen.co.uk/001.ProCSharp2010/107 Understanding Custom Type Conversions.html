<h1>Understanding Custom Type Conversions</h1>
  <p>Let’s now examine a topic closely related to operator overloading: custom type conversions. To set the
stage for the discussion, let’s quickly review the notion of explicit and implicit conversions between
numerical data and related class types.</p>
<h2>Recall: Numerical Conversions</h2>
<p>In terms of the intrinsic numerical types (sbyte, int, float, etc.), an explicit conversion is required when
you attempt to store a larger value in a smaller container as this may result in a loss of data. Basically,
this is your way to tell the compiler, “Leave me alone, I know what I am trying to do.” Conversely, an
implicit conversion happens automatically when you attempt to place a smaller type in a destination
type that will not result in a loss of data:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
{
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> a = 123;
    <span class="kwrd">long</span> b = a; <span class="rem">// Implicit conversion from int to long</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> c = (<span class="kwrd">int</span>) b; <span class="rem">// Explicit conversion from long to int</span>
}</pre>
<h2>Recall: Conversions Among Related Class Types</h2>
<p>As shown in Chapter 6, class types may be related by classical inheritance (the “is-a” relationship). In
this case, the C# conversion process allows you to cast up and down the class hierarchy. For example, a
derived class can always be implicitly cast to a base type. However, if you wish to store a base class type
in a derived variable, you must perform an explicit cast:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Two related class types.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Base{}
<span class="kwrd">class</span> Derived : Base{}

<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {    
        <span class="rem">// Implicit cast between derived to base.</span>
        Base myBaseType;
        myBaseType = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Derived();

        <span class="rem">// Must explicitly cast to store base reference</span>
        <span class="rem">// in derived type.</span>
        Derived myDerivedType = (Derived)myBaseType;
    }
}</pre>
<p>This explicit cast works due to the fact that the Base and Derived classes are related by classical
inheritance. However, what if you have two class types in different hierarchies with no common parent
(other than System.Object) that require conversions? Given that they are not related by classical
inheritance, explicit casting offers no help.</p>
<p>On a related note, consider value types, such as structures. Assume you have two .NET structures
named Square and Rectangle. Given that structures cannot leverage classic inheritance (as they are
always sealed), you have no natural way to cast between these seemingly related types.</p>
<p>While you could create helper methods in the structures (such as Rectangle.ToSquare()), C# lets you
build custom conversion routines that allow your types to respond to the () casting operator. Therefore,
if you configured the structures correctly, you would be able to use the following syntax to explicitly
convert between them as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Convert a Rectangle to a Square!</span>
Rectangle rect;
rect.Width = 3;
rect.Height = 10;
Square sq = (Square)rect;</pre>
<h2>Creating Custom Conversion Routines</h2>
  <p>Begin by creating a new Console Application named CustomConversions. C# provides two keywords,
explicit and implicit, that you can use to control how your types respond during an attempted
conversion. Assume you have the following class definitions:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Rectangle
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Width {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Height {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Rectangle(<span class="kwrd">int</span> w, <span class="kwrd">int</span> h)
    {
        Width = w; Height = h;
    }
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Rectangle(){}

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; Height; i++)
        {
            <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> j = 0; j &lt; Width; j++)
            {
                Console.Write(<span class="str">"*"</span>);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"[Width = {0}; Height = {1}]"</span>,
            Width, Height);
    }
}

<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Square
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Length {<span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>;}
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Square(<span class="kwrd">int</span> l)
    {
        Length = l;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> Square(){}
    
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Draw()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> i = 0; i &lt; Length; i++)
        {
            <span class="kwrd">for</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span> j = 0; j &lt; Length; j++)
            {
                Console.Write(<span class="str">"*"</span>);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">override</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ToString()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span>.Format(<span class="str">"[Length = {0}]"</span>, Length); }

    <span class="rem">// Rectangles can be explicitly converted</span>
    <span class="rem">// into Squares.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">explicit</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> Square(Rectangle r)
    {
        Square s = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Square();
        s.Length = r.Height;
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> s;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that this iteration of the Square type defines an explicit conversion operator. Like the process
of overloading an operator, conversion routines make use of the C# operator keyword, in conjunction
with the explicit or implicit keyword, and must be defined as static. The incoming parameter is the
entity you are converting from, while the operator type is the entity you are converting to.</p>
<p>In this case, the assumption is that a square (being a geometric pattern in which all sides are of
equal length) can be obtained from the height of a rectangle. Thus, you are free to convert a Rectangle
into a Square as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Conversions *****\n"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Make a Rectangle.</span>
    Rectangle r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(15, 4);
    Console.WriteLine(r.ToString());
    r.Draw();

    Console.WriteLine();

    <span class="rem">// Convert r into a Square,</span>
    <span class="rem">// based on the height of the Rectangle.</span>

    Square s = (Square)r;
    Console.WriteLine(s.ToString());
    s.Draw();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>The output can be seen in Figure 12-3.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure12_03.png" alt="Figure 12-3" />
<p><b>Figure 12-3.</b> Converting a Rectangle structure to a Square structure</p>
<p>While it may not be all that helpful to convert a Rectangle into a Square within the same scope,
assume you have a function that has been designed to take Square parameters.</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This method requires a Square type.</span>
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> DrawSquare(Square sq)
{
    Console.WriteLine(sq.ToString());
    sq.Draw();
}</pre>
<p>Using your explicit conversion operation on the Square type, you can now pass in Rectangle types
for processing using an explicit cast:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Convert Rectangle to Square to invoke method.</span>
    Rectangle rect = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle(10, 5);
    DrawSquare((Square)rect);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Additional Explicit Conversions for the Square Type</h2>
  <p>Now that you can explicitly convert Rectangles into Squares, let’s examine a few additional explicit
conversions. Given that a square is symmetrical on all sides, it might be helpful to provide an explicit
conversion routine that allows the caller to cast from an integer type into a Square (which, of course, will
have a side length equal to the incoming integer). Likewise, what if you were to update Square such that
the caller can cast from a Square into a System.Int32? Here is the calling logic:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Converting an int to a Square.</span>
    Square sq2 = (Square)90;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"sq2 = {0}"</span>, sq2);

    <span class="rem">// Converting a Square to a int.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">int</span> side = (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)sq2;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Side length of sq2 = {0}"</span>, side);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>and here is the update to the Square class:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Square
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">explicit</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> Square(<span class="kwrd">int</span> sideLength)
    {
        Square newSq = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Square();
        newSq.Length = sideLength;
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> newSq;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">explicit</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> (Square s)
    {<span class="kwrd">return</span> s.Length;}
}</pre>
<p>To be honest, converting from a Square into an integer may not be the most intuitive (or useful)
operation. However, it does point out a very important fact regarding custom conversion routines: the
compiler does not care what you convert to or from, as long as you have written syntactically correct
code.</p>
<p>Thus, as with overloading operators, just because you can create an explicit cast operation for a
given type does not mean you should. Typically, this technique will be most helpful when you’re
creating .NET structure types, given that they are unable to participate in classical inheritance (where
casting comes for free).</p>
<h2>Defining Implicit Conversion Routines</h2>
  <p>Thus far, you have created various custom explicit conversion operations. However, what about the
following implicit conversion?</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Attempt to make an implicit cast?</span>
    Square s3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Square();
    s3.Length = 83;
    Rectangle rect2 = s3;

    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>This code will not compile, given that you have not provided an implicit conversion routine for the
Rectangle type. Now here is the catch: it is illegal to define explicit and implicit conversion functions on
the same type if they do not differ by their return type or parameter set. This might seem like a
limitation; however, the second catch is that when a type defines an implicit conversion routine, it is
legal for the caller to make use of the explicit cast syntax!</p>
<p>Confused? To clear things up, let’s add an implicit conversion routine to the Rectangle structure
using the C# implicit keyword (note that the following code assumes the width of the resulting
Rectangle is computed by multiplying the side of the Square by 2):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Rectangle
{
...
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">implicit</span> <span class="kwrd">operator</span> Rectangle(Square s)
    {
        Rectangle r = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Rectangle();
        r.Height = s.Length;

        <span class="rem">// Assume the length of the new Rectangle with</span>
        <span class="rem">// (Length x 2)</span>
        r.Width = s.Length * 2;
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> r;
    }
}</pre>
<p>With this update, you are now able to convert between types as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Implicit cast OK!</span>
    Square s3 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Square();
    s3.Length= 7;
    Rectangle rect2 = s3;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"rect2 = {0}"</span>, rect2);
    DrawSquare(s3);
    
    <span class="rem">// Explicit cast syntax still OK!</span>
    Square s4 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Square();
    s4.Length = 3;
    Rectangle rect3 = (Rectangle)s4;
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"rect3 = {0}"</span>, rect3);
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>The Internal Representation of Custom Conversion Routines</h2>
  <p>Like overloaded operators, methods that are qualified with the implicit or explicit keywords have
"special" names in terms of CIL: op_Implicit and op_Explicit, respectively (see Figure 12-4).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure12_04.png" alt="Figure 12-4" />
<p><b>Figure 12-4.</b> CIL representation of user-defined conversion routines</p>
<p><b>Note </b> The Visual Studio 2010 Object Browser shows custom conversion operators using the “explicit operator”
and "implicit operator" icons.</p>
<p>That wraps up our look at defining custom conversion routines. As with overloaded operators,
remember that this bit of syntax is simply a shorthand notation for “normal” member functions, and in
this light it is always optional. When used correctly, however, custom structures can be used more
naturally, as they can be treated as true class types related by inheritance.</p>
