<h1>The Internal Representation of LINQ Query Statements</h1>
  <p>At this point, you have been introduced to the process of building query expressions using various C#
query operators (such as from, in, where, orderby, and select). Also, you discovered that some
functionality of the LINQ to Objects API can only be accessed when calling extension methods of the
Enumerable class. The truth of the matter, however, is that when compiled, the C# compiler actually
translates all C# LINQ operators into calls on methods of the Enumerable class. In fact, if you were really a
glutton for punishment, you could build all of your LINQ statements using nothing but the underlying
object model.</p>
<p>A great many of the methods of Enumerable have been prototyped to take delegates as arguments. In
particular, many methods require a generic delegate named Func&lt;&gt; defined within the System
namespace of System.Core.dll. For example, consider the Where() method of Enumerable which is called
on your behalf when you use the C# where LINQ query operator:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Overloaded versions of the Enumerable.Where&lt;T&gt;() method.</span>
<span class="rem">// Note the second parameter is of type System.Func&lt;&gt;.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; Where&lt;TSource&gt;(<span class="kwrd">this</span> IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; source,
    System.Func&lt;TSource,<span class="kwrd">int</span>,<span class="kwrd">bool</span>&gt; predicate)

<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; Where&lt;TSource&gt;(<span class="kwrd">this</span> IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; source,
    System.Func&lt;TSource,<span class="kwrd">bool</span>&gt; predicate)</pre>
<p>The Func&lt;&gt; delegate (as the name implies) represents a pattern for a given function with a set of
arguments and a return value. If you were to examine this type using the Visual Studio 2010 object
browser, you’ll notice that the Func&lt;&gt; delegate can take between zero and four input arguments (here
typed T1, T2, T3, and T4 and named arg1, arg2, arg3, and arg4), and a return type denoted by TResult:</p> 
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// The various formats of the Func&lt;&gt; delegate.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> TResult Func&lt;T1,T2,T3,T4,TResult&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2, T3 arg3, T4 arg4)

<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> TResult Func&lt;T1,T2,T3,TResult&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2, T3 arg3)

<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> TResult Func&lt;T1,T2,TResult&gt;(T1 arg1, T2 arg2)

<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> TResult Func&lt;T1,TResult&gt;(T1 arg1)

<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">delegate</span> TResult Func&lt;TResult&gt;()</pre>
<p>Given that many members of System.Linq.Enumerable demand a delegate as input, when invoking
them, you can either manually create a new delegate type and author the necessary target methods,
make use of a C# anonymous method, or define a proper lambda expression. Regardless of which
approach you take, the end result is identical.</p>
<p>While it is true that making use of C# LINQ query operators is far and away the simplest way to build
a LINQ query expression, let’s walk through each of these possible approaches just so you can see the
connection between the C# query operators and the underlying Enumerable type.</p>
<h2>Building Query Expressions with Query Operators (Revisited)</h2>
  <p>To begin, create a new Console Application named LinqUsingEnumerable. The Program class will define
a series of static helper methods (each of which is called within the Main() method) to illustrate the
various manners in which you can build LINQ query expressions.</p>
<p>The first method, QueryStringsWithOperators(), offers the most straightforward way to build a
query expression and is identical to the code seen in the LinqOverArray example found earlier in this
chapter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryStringWithOperators()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Using Query Operators *****"</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};

    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = <span class="kwrd">from</span> game <span class="kwrd">in</span> currentVideoGames
        where game.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>) orderby game select game;

    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">string</span> s <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, s);
}</pre>
<p>The obvious benefit of using C# query operators to build query expressions is the fact that the
Func&lt;&gt; delegates and calls on the Enumerable type are out of sight and out of mind, as it is the job of the
C# compiler to perform this translation. To be sure, building LINQ expressions using various query
operators (from, in, where, or orderby) is the most common and straightforward approach.</p>
<h2>Building Query Expressions Using the Enumerable Type and Lambda Expressions</h2>
  <p>Keep in mind that the LINQ query operators used here are simply shorthand versions for calling various
extension methods defined by the Enumerable type. Consider the following
QueryStringsWithEnumerableAndLambdas() method, which is processing the local string array now
making direct use of the Enumerable extension methods:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryStringsWithEnumerableAndLambdas()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Using Enumerable / Lambda Expressions *****"</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};

    <span class="rem">// Build a query expression using extension methods</span>
    <span class="rem">// granted to the Array via the Enumerable type.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = currentVideoGames.Where(game =&gt; game.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>))
        .OrderBy(game =&gt; game).Select(game =&gt; game);

    <span class="rem">// Print out the results.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> game <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, game);
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>Here, you begin by calling the Where() extension method on the currentVideoGames string array.
Recall the Array class receives this via an extension method granted by Enumerable. The
Enumerable.Where() method requires a System.Func&lt;T1, TResult&gt; delegate parameter. The first type
parameter of this delegate represents the IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; compatible data to process (an array of strings
in this case), while the second type parameter represents the method result data, which is obtained from
a single statement fed into the lambda expression.</p>
<p>The return value of the Where() method is hidden from view in this code example, but under the
covers you are operating on an OrderedEnumerable type. From this object, you call the generic OrderBy()
method, which also requires a Func&lt; &gt; delegate parameter. This time, you are simply passing each item
in turn via a fitting lambda expression. The end result of calling OrderBy() is a new ordered sequence of
the initial data</p>
<p>Last but not least, you call the Select() method off the sequence returned from OrderBy(), which
results in the final set of data that is stored in an implicitly typed variable named subset.</p>
<p>To be sure, this “long hand” LINQ query is a bit more complex to tease apart than the previous C#
LINQ query operator example. Part of the complexity is no doubt due to the chaining together of calls
using the dot operator. Here is the exact same query, with each step broken into discrete chunks:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryStringsWithEnumerableAndLambdas()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Using Enumerable / Lambda Expressions *****"</span>);

    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};

    <span class="rem">// Build a query expression using extension methods</span>
    <span class="rem">// granted to the Array via the Enumerable type.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = currentVideoGames.Where(game =&gt; game.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>))
        .OrderBy(game =&gt; game).Select(game =&gt; game);

    <span class="rem">// Print out the results.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> game <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, game);
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>As you may agree, building a LINQ query expression using the methods of the Enumerable class
directly is much more verbose than making use of the C# query operators. As well, given that the
methods of Enumerable require delegates as parameters, you will typically need to author lambda
expressions to allow the input data to be processed by the underlying delegate target.</p>
<h2>Building Query Expressions Using the Enumerable Type and Anonymous Methods</h2>
  <p>Given that C# lambda expressions are simply shorthand notations for working with anonymous
methods, consider the third query expression created within the QueryStringsWithAnonymousMethods()
helper function:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryStringsWithAnonymousMethods()
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Using Anonymous Methods *****"</span>);
    
    <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
        <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};
    
    <span class="rem">// Build the necessary Func&lt;&gt; delegates using anonymous methods.</span>
    Func&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">bool</span>&gt; searchFilter =
        <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span> game) { <span class="kwrd">return</span> game.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>); };
    Func&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">string</span>&gt; itemToProcess = <span class="kwrd">delegate</span>(<span class="kwrd">string</span> s) { <span class="kwrd">return</span> s; };
    
    <span class="rem">// Pass the delegates into the methods of Enumerable.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = currentVideoGames.Where(searchFilter)
        .OrderBy(itemToProcess).Select(itemToProcess);
    
    <span class="rem">// Print out the results.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> game <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, game);
    Console.WriteLine();
}</pre>
<p>This iteration of the query expression is even more verbose, because you are manually creating the
Func&lt;&gt; delegates used by the Where(), OrderBy(), and Select() methods of the Enumerable class. On the
plus side, the anonymous method syntax does keep all the delegate processing contained within a single
method definition. Nevertheless, this method is functionally equivalent to the
QueryStringsWithEnumerableAndLambdas() and QueryStringsWithOperators() methods created in the
previous sections.</p>
<h2>Building Query Expressions Using the Enumerable Type and Raw Delegates</h2>
  <p>Finally, if you want to build a query expression using the really verbose approach, you could avoid the
use of lambdas/anonymous method syntax and directly create delegate targets for each Func&lt;&gt; type.
Here is the final iteration of your query expression, modeled within a new class type named
VeryComplexQueryExpression:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> VeryComplexQueryExpression
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> QueryStringsWithRawDelegates()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Using Raw Delegates *****"</span>);

        <span class="kwrd">string</span>[] currentVideoGames = {<span class="str">"Morrowind"</span>, <span class="str">"Uncharted 2"</span>,
            <span class="str">"Fallout 3"</span>, <span class="str">"Daxter"</span>, <span class="str">"System Shock 2"</span>};

        <span class="rem">// Build the necessary Func&lt;&gt; delegates.</span>
        Func&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">bool</span>&gt; searchFilter = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Func&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">bool</span>&gt;(Filter);
        Func&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>, <span class="kwrd">string</span>&gt; itemToProcess = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Func&lt;<span class="kwrd">string</span>,<span class="kwrd">string</span>&gt;(ProcessItem);

        <span class="rem">// Pass the delegates into the methods of Enumerable.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> subset = currentVideoGames
            .Where(searchFilter).OrderBy(itemToProcess).Select(itemToProcess);

        <span class="rem">// Print out the results.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> game <span class="kwrd">in</span> subset)
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"Item: {0}"</span>, game);
        Console.WriteLine();
    }

    <span class="rem">// Delegate targets.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> Filter(<span class="kwrd">string</span> game) {<span class="kwrd">return</span> game.Contains(<span class="str">" "</span>);}
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> ProcessItem(<span class="kwrd">string</span> game) { <span class="kwrd">return</span> game; }
}</pre>
<p>You can test this iteration of your string processing logic by calling this method within Main()
method of the Program class as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
VeryComplexQueryExpression.QueryStringsWithRawDelegates();</pre>
<p>If you were to now run the application to test each possible approach, it should not be too
surprising that the output is identical regardless of the path taken. Keep the following points in mind
regarding how LINQ query expressions are represented under the covers:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Query expressions are created using various C# query operators.</li>
 <li>Query operators are simply shorthand notations for invoking extension methods
defined by the System.Linq.Enumerable type.</li>
 <li>Many methods of Enumerable require delegates (Func&lt;&gt; in particular) as
parameters.</li>
 <li>Any method requiring a delegate parameter can instead be passed a lambda
expression.</li>
 <li>Lambda expressions are simply anonymous methods in disguise (which greatly
improve readability).</li>
 <li>Anonymous methods are shorthand notations for allocating a raw delegate and
manually building a delegate target method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew! That might have been a bit deeper under the hood than you wish to have gone, but I hope
this discussion has helped you understand what the user-friendly C# query operators are actually doing
behind the scenes.</p>
