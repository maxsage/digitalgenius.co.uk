    <h1>The Role of the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK</h1>
    <p>One common misconception regarding .NET development is the belief that programmers must
    purchase a copy of Visual Studio in order to build their C# applications. The truth of the matter is that
    you are able to build any sort of .NET program using the freely downloadable .NET Framework 4.0
    Software Development Kit (SDK). This SDK provides you with numerous managed compilers,
    command-line utilities, sample code, the .NET class libraries, and a complete documentation system.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b> The .NET Framework 4.0 SDK setup program (dotnetfx40_full_setup.exe) can be obtained from
    the .NET download web site (http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework).</p>
    <p>Now, be aware that if you are going to be using Visual Studio 2010 or Visual C# 2010 Express, you
    have no need to manually install the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK. When you install either of these
    products, the SDK is installed automatically, thereby giving you everything you need out of the box.</p>
    <p>However, if you are not going to be using a Microsoft IDE as you work through this text, be sure to
    install the SDK before proceeding.</p>
    <h2>The Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt</h2>
    <p>When you install the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK, Visual Studio 2010, or Visual C# 2010 Express, you will
    end up with a number of new directories on your local hard drive, each of which contains various .NET
    development tools. Many of these tools are driven from the command prompt, so if you wish to use
    these utilities from any Windows command window, you will need to register these paths with the
    operating system.</p>
    <p>While you could update your PATH variable manually to do so, you can save yourself some time by
    simply making use of the Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt that is accessible from the Start &gt; All
    Programs &gt; Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 &gt; Visual Studio Tools folder (see Figure 2-1).</p>

    <p>The benefit of using this particular command prompt is that it has been preconfigured to provide
    access to each of the .NET development tools. Assuming you have a .NET development environment
    installed, type the following command and press the Enter key:</p>
    <p>csc -?</p>
    <p>If all is well, you should see a list of command-line arguments of the C# command-line compiler
    (where csc stands for the C-sharp compiler).</p>
