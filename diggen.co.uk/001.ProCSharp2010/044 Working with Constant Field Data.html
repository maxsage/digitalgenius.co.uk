    <h1>Working with Constant Field Data</h1>
    <p>C# offers the const keyword to define constant data, which can never change after the initial assignment.
    As you might guess, this can be helpful when you are defining a set of known values for use in your
    applications that are logically connected to a given class or structure.</p>
    <p>Assume you are building a utility class named MyMathClass that needs to define a value for the value
    PI (which you will assume to be 3.14). Begin by creating a new Console Application project named
    ConstData. Given that you would not want to allow other developers to change this value in code, PI
    could be modeled with the following constant:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">namespace</span> ConstData
{
    <span class="kwrd">class</span> MyMathClass
    {
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">const</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> PI = 3.14;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
    {
        <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Const *****\n"</span>);
            Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The value of PI is: {0}"</span>, MyMathClass.PI);

            <span class="rem">// Error! Can't change a constant!</span>
            <span class="rem">// MyMathClass.PI = 3.1444;</span>

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Notice that you are referencing the constant data defined by MyMathClass using a class name prefix
    (i.e., MyMathClass.PI). This is due to the fact that constant fields of a class are implicitly static. However,
    it is permissible to define and access a local constant variable within a type member. By way of example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> LocalConstStringVariable()
{
    <span class="rem">// A local constant data point can be directly accessed.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">const</span> <span class="kwrd">string</span> fixedStr = <span class="str">"Fixed string Data"</span>;
    Console.WriteLine(fixedStr);

    <span class="rem">// Error!</span>
    fixedStr = <span class="str">"This will not work!"</span>;
}</pre>
    <p>Regardless of where you define a constant piece of data, the one point to always remember is that
    the initial value assigned to the constant must be specified at the time you define the constant. Thus, if
    you were to modify your MyMathClass in such a way that the value of PI is assigned in a class constructor
    as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyMathClass
{
    <span class="rem">// Try to set PI in ctor?</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">const</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> PI;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MyMathClass()
    {
        <span class="rem">// Error!</span>
        PI = 3.14;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>you would receive a compile-time error. The reason for this restriction has to do with the fact the value
    of constant data must be known at compile time. Constructors, as you know, are invoked at runtime.</p>
    <h2>Understanding Read-Only Fields</h2>
    <p>Closely related to constant data is the notion of read-only field data (which should not be confused with
    a read-only property). Like a constant, a read-only field cannot be changed after the initial assignment.
    However, unlike a constant, the value assigned to a read-only field can be determined at runtime, and
    therefore can legally be assigned within the scope of a constructor, but nowhere else.</p>
    <p>This can be very helpful when you don't know the value of a field until runtime, perhaps because
    you need to read an external file to obtain the value, but wish to ensure that the value will not change
    after that point. For the sake of illustration, assume the following update to MyMathClass:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyMathClass
{
    <span class="rem">// Read-only fields can be assigned in ctors,</span>
    <span class="rem">// but nowhere else.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> PI;

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MyMathClass ()
    {
        PI = 3.14;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>Again, any attempt to make assignments to a field marked readonly outside the scope of a
    constructor results in a compiler error:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyMathClass
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> PI;
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> MyMathClass ()
    {
        PI = 3.14;
    }

    <span class="rem">// Error!</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ChangePI()
    { PI = 3.14444;}
}</pre>
    <h2>Static Read-Only Fields</h2>
    <p>Unlike a constant field, read-only fields are not implicitly static. Thus, if you wish to expose PI from the class
    level, you must explicitly make use of the static keyword. If you know the value of a static read-only field at
    compile time, the initial assignment looks very similar to that of a constant:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyMathClass
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> PI = 3.14;
}

<span class="kwrd">class</span> Program
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** Fun with Const *****"</span>);
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"The value of PI is: {0}"</span>, MyMathClass.PI);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}</pre>
    <p>However, if the value of a static read-only field is not known until runtime, you must make use of a
    static constructor as described earlier in this chapter:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyMathClass
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">readonly</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> PI;
    
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> MyMathClass()
    { PI = 3.14; }
}</pre>
