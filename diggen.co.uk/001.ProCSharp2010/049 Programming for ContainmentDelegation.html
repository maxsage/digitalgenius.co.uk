<h1>Programming for Containment/Delegation</h1>
<p>Recall that code reuse comes in two flavors. You have just explored the classical “is-a” relationship.
Before you examine the third pillar of OOP (polymorphism), let’s examine the “has-a” relationship (also
known as the containment/delegation model or aggregation). Assume you have created a new class that
models an employee benefits package:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// This new type will function as a contained class.</span>
<span class="kwrd">class</span> BenefitPackage
{
    <span class="rem">// Assume we have other members that represent</span>
    <span class="rem">// dental/health benefits, and so on.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> ComputePayDeduction()
    {
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> 125.0;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Obviously, it would be rather odd to establish an “is-a” relationship between the BenefitPackage
class and the employee types. (Employee “is-a” BenefitPackage? I don’t think so.) However, it should be
clear that some sort of relationship between the two could be established. In short, you would like to
express the idea that each employee “has-a” BenefitPackage. To do so, you can update the Employee
class definition as follows:</p>
    <!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Employees now have benefits.</span>
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// Contain a BenefitPackage object.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> BenefitPackage empBenefits = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BenefitPackage();
...
}</pre>
<p>At this point, you have successfully contained another object. However, to expose the functionality
of the contained object to the outside world requires delegation. Delegation is simply the act of adding
public members to the containing class that make use of the contained object’s functionality.</p>
<p>For example, you could update the Employee class to expose the contained empBenefits object using
a custom property as well as make use of its functionality internally using a new method named
GetBenefitCost():</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// Contain a BenefitPackage object.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">protected</span> BenefitPackage empBenefits = <span class="kwrd">new</span> BenefitPackage();

    <span class="rem">// Expose certain benefit behaviors of object.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> GetBenefitCost()
    { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empBenefits.ComputePayDeduction(); }

    <span class="rem">// Expose object through a custom property.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> BenefitPackage Benefits
    {
        <span class="kwrd">get</span> { <span class="kwrd">return</span> empBenefits; }
        <span class="kwrd">set</span> { empBenefits = value; }
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>In the following updated Main() method, notice how you can interact with the internal
BenefitsPackage type defined by the Employee type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">"***** The Employee Class Hierarchy *****\n"</span>);
    Manager chucky = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Manager(<span class="str">"Chucky"</span>, 50, 92, 100000, <span class="str">"333-23-2322"</span>, 9000);
    <span class="kwrd">double</span> cost = chucky.GetBenefitCost();
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<h2>Understanding Nested Type Definitions</h2>
<p>The previous chapter briefly mentioned the concept of nested types, which is a spin on the “has-a”
relationship you have just examined. In C# (as well as other .NET languages), it is possible to define a
type (enum, class, interface, struct, or delegate) directly within the scope of a class or structure. When
you have done so, the nested (or “inner”) type is considered a member of the nesting (or “outer”) class,
and in the eyes of the runtime can be manipulated like any other member (fields, properties, methods,
and events). The syntax used to nest a type is quite straightforward:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> OuterClass
{
    <span class="rem">// A public nested type can be used by anybody.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> PublicInnerClass {}

    <span class="rem">// A private nested type can only be used by members</span>
    <span class="rem">// of the containing class.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> PrivateInnerClass {}
}</pre>
<p>Although the syntax is clean, understanding why you might want to do this may not readily
apparent. To understand this technique, ponder the following traits of nesting a type:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Nested types allow you to gain complete control over the access level of the inner
type, as they may be declared privately (recall that non-nested classes cannot be
declared using the private keyword).</p>
</li>
<li>
 <p>Because a nested type is a member of the containing class, it can access private
members of the containing class.</p>
</li>
<li>
 <p>Oftentimes, a nested type is only useful as a helper for the outer class, and is not
intended for use by the outside world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a type nests another class type, it can create member variables of the type, just as it would for
any point of data. However, if you wish to make use of a nested type from outside of the containing type,
you must qualify it by the scope of the nesting type. Consider the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
    <span class="rem">// Create and use the public inner class. OK!</span>
    OuterClass.PublicInnerClass inner;
    inner = <span class="kwrd">new</span> OuterClass.PublicInnerClass();

    <span class="rem">// Compiler Error! Cannot access the private class.</span>
    OuterClass.PrivateInnerClass inner2;
    inner2 = <span class="kwrd">new</span> OuterClass.PrivateInnerClass();
}</pre>
<p>To make use of this concept within the employees example, assume you have now nested the
BenefitPackage directly within the Employee class type:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BenefitPackage
    {
        <span class="rem">// Assume we have other members that represent</span>
        <span class="rem">// dental/health benefits, and so on.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> ComputePayDeduction()
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> 125.0;
        }
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>The nesting process can be as “deep” as you require. For example, assume you wish to create an
enumeration named BenefitPackageLevel, which documents the various benefit levels an employee
may choose. To programmatically enforce the tight connection between Employee, BenefitPackage, and
BenefitPackageLevel, you could nest the enumeration as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Employee nests BenefitPackage.</span>
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> Employee
{
    <span class="rem">// BenefitPackage nests BenefitPackageLevel.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> BenefitPackage
    {
        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">enum</span> BenefitPackageLevel
        {
            Standard, Gold, Platinum
        }

        <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">double</span> ComputePayDeduction()
        {
            <span class="kwrd">return</span> 125.0;
        }
    }
...
}</pre>
<p>Because of the nesting relationships, note how you are required to make use of this enumeration:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args)
{
...
    <span class="rem">// Define my benefit level.</span>
    Employee.BenefitPackage.BenefitPackageLevel myBenefitLevel =
        Employee.BenefitPackage.BenefitPackageLevel.Platinum;
    Console.ReadLine();
}</pre>
<p>Excellent! At this point you have been exposed to a number of keywords (and concepts) that allow
you to build hierarchies of related types via classical inheritance, containment, and nested types. If the
details aren’t crystal clear right now, don’t sweat it. You will be building a number of additional
hierarchies over the remainder of this text. Next up, let’s examine the final pillar of OOP: polymorphism.</p>
