<h1>Understanding WPF’s Animation Services</h1>
    <p>In addition to the graphical rendering services you examined in Chapter 29, WPF supplies a
programming interface to support animation services. The term animation may bring to mind visions of
spinning company logos, a sequence of rotating image resources (to provide the illusion of movement),
text bouncing across the screen, or specific types of programs such as video games or multimedia
applications.</p>
<p>While WPF’s animation APIs could certainly be used for such purposes, animation can be used any
time you wish to give an application additional flair. For example, you could build an animation for a
button on a screen that magnifies slightly when the mouse cursor hovers within its boundaries (and
shrinks back once the mouse cursor moves beyond the boundaries). Or you could animate a window so
that it closes using a particular visual appearance, such as slowly fading into transparency. In fact, WPF’s
animation support can be used within any sort of application (a business application, multimedia
programs, video games, etc.) whenever you wish to provide a more engaging user experience.</p>
<p>As with many other aspects of WPF, the notion of building animations is nothing new. What is new
is that, unlike other APIs you may have used in the past (including Windows Forms), developers are not
required to author the necessary infrastructure by hand. Under WPF, there’s no need to create the
background threads or timers used to advance the animation sequence, define custom types to
represent the animation, erase and redraw images, or bother with tedious mathematical calculations.</p>
<p>Like other aspects of WPF, we can build an animation entirely using XAML, entirely using C# code,
or using a combination of the two. Furthermore, we can use Microsoft Expression Blend to design an
animation using integrated tools and wizards—without seeing a bit of C# or XAML in the foreground.
You will see how to use Blend to author animations in the next chapter during our discussion of control
templates. For now, let’s get to know the overall role of the animation API.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Visual Studio 2010 has no support for authoring animations using GUI animation tools. If you author an
animation with Visual Studio, you will do so by typing in the XAML directly.</p>
<h2>The Role of the Animation Class Types</h2>
<p>To understand WPF’s animation support, we must begin by examining the animation classes within the
System.Windows.Media.Animation namespace of PresentationCore.dll. Here you will find over 100
different class types that are named using the Animation token.</p>
<p>All of these classes can be placed into one of three broad categories. First of all, any class that follows
the name convention DataTypeAnimation (ByteAnimation, ColorAnimation, DoubleAnimation,
In32Animation, etc.) allows you to work with linear interpolation animations. This enables you to change
a value smoothly over time from a start value to a final value.</p>
<p>Next, the classes that follow the naming convention DataTypeAnimationUsingKeyFrames
(StringAnimationUsingKeyFrames, DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames, PointAnimationUsingKeyFrames,
etc.) represent “key frame animations,” which allow you to cycle through a set of defined values over a
period of time. For example, you could use keyframes to change the caption of a button by cycling
through a series of individual characters.</p>
<p>Finally, classes that follow the DataTypeAnimationUsingPath naming convention
(DoubleAnimationUsingPath, PointAnimationUsingPath, among others) are path-based animations that
allow you to animate objects to move along a path you define. By way of an example, if you were
building a GPS application, you could use a path-based animation to move an item along the quickest
travel route to the user’s destination.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, these classes are not used to somehow provide an animation sequence directly to a
variable of a particular data type (after all, how exactly could we animate the value “9” using an
Int32Animation?).</p>
<p>For example, consider the Label type’s Height and Width properties, both of which are dependency
properties wrapping a double. If you wish to define an animation that would increase the height of a
label over a time span, you could connect a DoubleAnimation object to the Height property and allow
WPF to take care of the details of performing the actual animation itself. By way of another example, if
you wish to transition the color of a brush type from green to yellow over a period of 5 seconds, you
could do so using the ColorAnimation type.</p>
<p>To be very clear, these Animation classes can be connected to any dependency property of a given
object that matches the underlying types. As explained in Chapter 31, dependency properties are a
specialized form of property required by many WPF services including animation, data binding, and
styles.</p>
<p>By convention, a dependency property is defined as a static read-only field of the class, and is
named by suffixing the word Property to the normal property name. For example, the dependency
property for the Height property of a Button would be accessed in code using Button.HeightProperty.</p>
<h2>The To, From, and By Properties</h2>
<p>All Animation classes define a handful of key properties that control the starting and ending values used
to perform the animation:</p>
<ul>
 <li>To: This property represents the animation’s ending value.</li>
 <li>From: This property represents the animation’s starting value.</li>
 <li>By: This property represents the total amount by which the animation changes its starting value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the fact that all Animation classes support the To, From, and By properties, they do not receive
them via virtual members of a base class. The reason for this is that the underlying types wrapped by
these properties vary greatly (integers, colors, Thickness objects, etc.), and representing all possibilities
using a single base class would result in very complex coding constructs.</p>
<p>On a related note, you might also wonder why .NET generics were not used to define a single generic
animation class with a single type parameter (e.g., Animate&lt;T&gt;). Again, given that there are so many
underlying data types (colors, vectors, ints, strings, etc.) used to animated dependency properties, it
would not be as clean a solution as you might expect (not to mention XAML has only limited support for
generic types).</p>
<h2>The Role of the Timeline Base Class</h2>
<p>Although a single base class was not used to define virtual To, From, and By properties, the Animation
classes do share a common base class: System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline. This type provides a
number of additional properties that control the pacing of the animation, as described in Table 30-1.</p>
<p><b>Table 30-1.</b> Key Members of the Timeline Base Class</p>
<table class="gridtable">
  <tr>
   <th>
    Properties
   </th>
   <th>
    Meaning in Life
   </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AccelerationRatio, DecelerationRatio, SpeedRatio
   </td>
   <td>
    These properties can be used to control the overall pacing of the animation
sequence.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    AutoReverse
   </td>
   <td>
    This property gets or sets a value that indicates whether the timeline plays in
reverse after it completes a forward iteration (the default value is false).
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    BeginTime
   </td>
   <td>
    This property gets or sets the time at which this timeline should begin. The
default value is 0, which begins the animation immediately.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    Duration
   </td>
   <td>
    This property allows you to set a duration of time to play the timeline.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
    FillBehavior, RepeatBehavior
   </td>
   <td>
    These properties are used to control what should happen once the timeline
has completed (repeat the animation, do nothing, etc.).
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Authoring an Animation in C# Code</h2>
<p>The chances are quite good that a majority of your WPF animation projects will be authored using the
Expression Blend animation editor, and will therefore be represented as markup. However, our first look
at WPF’s animation services will use nothing but C# code, as I feel it is a tad more straightforward.</p>
<p>Specifically, we will build a Window that contains a Button, which has the odd behavior of spinning
in a circle (based on the upper left corner) whenever the mouse enters its surface area. Begin by creating
a new WPF application named SpinningButtonAnimationApp, using Visual Studio 2010. Update the
initial markup like the following (note we are handling the button’s MouseEnter event):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">partial</span> <span class="kwrd">class</span> MainWindow : Window
{
    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">bool</span> isSpinning = <span class="kwrd">false</span>;

    <span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSpinner_MouseEnter(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, MouseEventArgs e)
    {
        <span class="kwrd">if</span> (!isSpinning)
        {
            isSpinning = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;

            <span class="rem">// Make a double animation object, and register</span>
            <span class="rem">// with the Completed event.</span>
            DoubleAnimation dblAnim = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DoubleAnimation();
            dblAnim.Completed += (o, s) =&gt; { isSpinning = <span class="kwrd">false</span>; };

            <span class="rem">// Set the start value and end value.</span>
            dblAnim.From = 0;
            dblAnim.To = 360;

            <span class="rem">// Now, create a RotateTransform object, and set</span>
            <span class="rem">// it to the RenderTransform property of our</span>
            <span class="rem">// button.</span>
            RotateTransform rt = <span class="kwrd">new</span> RotateTransform();
            btnSpinner.RenderTransform = rt;

            <span class="rem">// Now, animation the RotateTransform object.</span>
            rt.BeginAnimation(RotateTransform.AngleProperty, dblAnim);
        }
    }
}</pre>
<p>The first major task of this method is to configure a DoubleAnimation object, which will start at the
value 0 and end at the value 360. Notice that we are handling the Completed event on this object as well,
to toggle a class-level bool variable that is used to ensure that if an animation is currently being
performed, we don’t “reset” it to start again.</p>
<p>Next, we create a RotateTransform object that is connected to the RenderTransform property of our
Button control (btnSpinner). Last but not least, we inform the RenderTransform object to begin animating
its Angle property using our DoubleAnimation object. When you are authoring animations in code, you
typically do so by calling BeginAnimation(), and pass in the underlying dependency property you wish to
animate (remember, by convention, this is a static field on the class), followed by a related animation
object.</p>
<p>Let’s add another animation to the program, which will cause the button to fade into invisibility
when clicked. First, handle the Click event of the btnSpinner object, then add the following code in the
resulting event handler:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSpinner_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    DoubleAnimation dblAnim = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DoubleAnimation();
    dblAnim.From = 1.0;
    dblAnim.To = 0.0;
    btnSpinner.BeginAnimation(Button.OpacityProperty, dblAnim);
}</pre>
    <p>Here, we are changing the Opacity property value to fade the button out of view. Currently,
however, this is hard to do, as the button is spinning very fast! How, then, can we control the pace of an
animation? Glad you asked.</p>
<h2>Controlling the Pacing of an Animation</h2>
<p>By default, an animation will take approximately one second to transition between the values assigned
to the From and To properties. Therefore, our button has one second to spin around a full 360 degree
angle, while the button will fade away to invisibility (when clicked) over the course of one second.</p>
<p>If you wish to define a custom amount of time for an animation’s transition, you may do so via the
animation object’s Duration property, which can be set to an instance of a Duration object. Typically, the
time span is established by passing a TimeSpan object to the Duration’s constructor. Consider the
following update that will give the button a full 4 seconds to rotate:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSpinner_MouseEnter(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    <span class="kwrd">if</span> (!isSpinning)
    {
        isSpinning = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;

        <span class="rem">// Make a double animation object, and register</span>
        <span class="rem">// with the Completed event.</span>
        DoubleAnimation dblAnim = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DoubleAnimation();
        dblAnim.Completed += (o, s) =&gt; { isSpinning = <span class="kwrd">false</span>; };

        <span class="rem">// Button has 4 seconds to finish the spin!</span>
        dblAnim.Duration = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(4));
...
    }
}</pre>
<p>With this adjustment, you should have a fighting chance to click the button while it is spinning, at
which point it will fade away.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The BeginTime property of an Animation class also takes a TimeSpan object. Recall that this
property can be set to establish a wait time before starting an animation sequence.</p>
<h2>Reversing and Looping an Animation</h2>
<p>You can also tell Animation objects to play an animation in reverse at the completion of the animation
sequence by setting the AutoReverse property to true. For example, if you wish to have the button come
back into view after it has faded away, you could author the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> btnSpinner_Click(<span class="kwrd">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    DoubleAnimation dblAnim = <span class="kwrd">new</span> DoubleAnimation();
    dblAnim.From = 1.0;
    dblAnim.To = 0.0;

    <span class="rem">// Reverse when done.</span>
    dblAnim.AutoReverse = <span class="kwrd">true</span>;
    btnSpinner.BeginAnimation(Button.OpacityProperty, dblAnim);
}</pre>
<p>If you’d like to have an animation repeat some number of times (or to never stop once activated),
you can do so using the RepeatBehavior property, which is common to all Animation classes. If you pass
in a simple numerical value to the constructor, you can specify a hard-coded number of times to repeat.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you pass in a TimeSpan object to the constructor, you can establish an amount of
time the animation should repeat. Finally, if you wish an animation to loop ad infinitum, you can simply
specify RepeatBehavior.Forever. Consider the following ways we could change the repeat behaviors of
either of the DoubleAnimation objects used in this example:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">// Loop forever.</span>
dblAnim.RepeatBehavior = RepeatBehavior.Forever;

<span class="rem">// Loop three times.</span>
dblAnim.RepeatBehavior = <span class="kwrd">new</span> RepeatBehavior(3);

<span class="rem">// Loop for 30 seconds.</span>
dblAnim.RepeatBehavior = <span class="kwrd">new</span> RepeatBehavior(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));</pre>
<p>That wraps up our investigation about how to animate aspects of an object using C# code and the
WPF animation API. Next, we will learn how to do the same using XAML.</p>
