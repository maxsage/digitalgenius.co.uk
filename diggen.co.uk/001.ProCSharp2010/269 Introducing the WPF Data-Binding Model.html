<h1>Introducing the WPF Data-Binding Model</h1>
    <p>Controls are often the target of various data-binding operations. Simply put, data binding is the act of
connecting control properties to data values that might change over the course of your application’s
lifetime. Doing so lets a user interface element display the state of a variable in your code. For example,
you might use data binding to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Check a CheckBox control based on a Boolean property of a given object.</li>
 <li>Display data in DataGrid objects from a relational database table.</li>
 <li>Connect a Label to an integer that represents the number of files in a folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use the intrinsic WPF data-binding engine, you must be aware of the distinction between
the source and the destination of the binding operation. As you might expect, the source of a databinding
operation is the data itself (e.g., a Boolean property or relational data), while the destination
(target) is the UI control property that uses the data content (e.g., a CheckBox or TextBox).</p>
<p>Truth be told, using the WPF data-binding infrastructure is always optional. If you were to roll your
own data-binding logic, the connection between a source and destination typically would involve
handling various events and authoring procedural code to connect the source and destination. For
example, if you had a ScrollBar on a window that needed to display its value on a Label type, you might
handle the ScrollBar’s ValueChanged event and update the Label’s content accordingly.</p>
<p>However, you can use WPF data binding to connect the source and destination directly in XAML (or
use C# code in your code file) without the need to handle various events or hard-code the connections
between the source and destination. Also, based on how you set up your data-binding logic, you can
ensure that the source and destination stay in sync if either of their values changes.</p>
<h2>Building the Data Binding Tab</h2>
<p>Using the Objects and Timeline editor, change the Grid of your third tab to a StackPanel. Now, use the
Assets Library and the Properties editor of Blend to build the following initial layout:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">TabItem</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="tabDataBinding"</span> <span class="attr">Header</span><span class="kwrd">="Data Binding"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="250"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">Content</span><span class="kwrd">="Move the scroll bar to see the current value"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

        <span class="rem">&lt;!-- The scrollbar's value is the source of this data bind --&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">ScrollBar</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="mySB"</span> <span class="attr">Orientation</span><span class="kwrd">="Horizontal"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span>
            <span class="attr">Minimum</span> = <span class="kwrd">"1"</span> <span class="attr">Maximum</span> = <span class="kwrd">"100"</span> <span class="attr">LargeChange</span><span class="kwrd">="1"</span> <span class="attr">SmallChange</span><span class="kwrd">="1"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

        <span class="rem">&lt;!-- The label's content will be bound to the scroll bar! --&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="labelSBThumb"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span>
            <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="2"</span> <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"0"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">TabItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Notice that the &lt;ScrollBar&gt; object (named mySB here) has been configured with a range between 1
and 100. The goal is to ensure that, as you reposition the thumb of the scrollbar (or click the left or right
arrow), the Label will automatically update with the current value.</p>
<h2>Establishing Data Bindings using Blend</h2>
<p>The glue that makes it possible to define a binding in XAML is the {Binding} markup extension. If you
wish to establish a binding between controls using Blend, you can do so easily. For this example, locate
the Content property of the Label object (in the Common Properties area of the Properties window) and
click the (very) small white square next to the property to open the Advanced Property options. From
here, select Data Binding (see Figure 28-44).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure28_44.png" alt="Figure 28-44" />
<p><b>Figure 28-44</b> </p>
<p>You are interested in the Element Property tab here because this will give you a list of all items in
your XAML file, which you can select as the source of the data-binding operation. Select this tab, and in
the Scene elements list box, find your ScrollBar object (named mySB). In the Properties list box, find the
Value property (see Figure 28-45). Click the OK button once you do this.</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure28_45.png" alt="Figure 28-45" />
<p><b>Figure 28-45</b> Selecting the source object and the property on the object</p>
<p>If you run your program again, you will find that the content of the label updates as you move the
thumb! Now look at the XAML the data binding tool generated on your behalf:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="labelSBThumb"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span> <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="2"</span>
    <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding Value, ElementName=mySB, Mode=Default}"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>Note the value assigned to the Label’s Content property. Here, the ElementName value represents the
source of the data-binding operation (the ScrollBar object), while the first item after the Binding
keyword (Value) represents (in this case) the property of the element to obtain.</p>
<p>If you have worked with WPF data binding previously, you might expect to see the use of the Path
token to set the property to observe on the object. For example, the following markup would also update
the Label correctly:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="labelSBThumb"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span>
    <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="2"</span> <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding Path=Value,
    ElementName=mySB, Mode=Default}"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>By default, Blend omits the Path= aspect of the data-binding operation unless the property is a subproperty
of another object (e.g., myObject.MyProperty.Object2.Property2).</p> 
<h2>The DataContext Property</h2>
<p>You can define a data-binding operation in XAML using an alternative format, where it is possible to
break out the values specified by the {Binding} markup extension by explicitly setting the DataContext
property to the source of the binding operation, as follows:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Breaking object/value apart via DataContext --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="labelSBThumb"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span>
    <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="2"</span>
    <span class="attr">DataContext</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding ElementName=mySB}"</span>
    <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding Path=Value}"</span> <span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>In the current example, the output would be identical if you were to modify the markup in this way.
Given this, you might wonder when you would want to set the DataContext property explicitly. Doing so
can be helpful because sub-elements can inherit its value in a tree of markup.</p>
<p>In this way, you can easily set the same data source to a family of controls, rather than having to
repeat a bunch of redundant "{Binding ElementName=X, Path=Y}" XAML values to multiple controls. For
example, assume you have added a new Button to the &lt;StackPanel&gt; of this tab (you’ll see why it is so
large in just a moment):</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">Content</span><span class="kwrd">="Click"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="140"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
<p>You could use Blend to generate data bindings for multiple controls, but instead try entering the
modified markup manually using the XAML editor:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="rem">&lt;!-- Note the StackPanel sets the DataContext property --&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span> <span class="attr">Width</span><span class="kwrd">="250"</span> <span class="attr">DataContext</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding ElementName=mySB}"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">Content</span><span class="kwrd">="Move the scroll bar to see the current value"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">ScrollBar</span> <span class="attr">Orientation</span><span class="kwrd">="Horizontal"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">Name</span><span class="kwrd">="mySB"</span>
        <span class="attr">Maximum</span> = <span class="kwrd">"100"</span> <span class="attr">LargeChange</span><span class="kwrd">="1"</span> <span class="attr">SmallChange</span><span class="kwrd">="1"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="rem">&lt;!-- Now both UI elements use the scrollbar's value in unique ways. --&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="labelSBThumb"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span> <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="2"</span>
        <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding Path=Value}"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Button</span> <span class="attr">Content</span><span class="kwrd">="Click"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="200"</span>
        <span class="attr">FontSize</span> = <span class="kwrd">"{Binding Path=Value}"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Here, you set the DataContext property on the &lt;StackPanel&gt; directly. Therefore, as you move the
thumb, you see not only the current value on the Label, but also see the font size of the Button grow and
shrink accordingly, based on the same value (see Figure 28-46 shows for one possible output).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure28_46.png" alt="Figure 28-46" />
<p><b>Figure 28-46</b> Binding the ScrollBar value to a Label and a Button</p>
<h2>Data Conversion Using IValueConverter</h2>
<p>The ScrollBar type uses a double to represent the value of the thumb, rather than an expected whole
number (e.g., an integer). Therefore, as you drag the thumb, you will find various floating-point numbers
displayed within the Label (e.g., 61.0576923076923). The end user would find this rather unintuitive
because he is most likely expecting to see whole numbers (e.g., 61, 62, and 63).</p>
<p>If you wish to convert the value of a data-binding operation into an alternative format, you could
create a custom class that implements the IValueConverter interface of the System.Windows.Data
namespace. This interface defines two members that allow you to perform the conversion to and from
the target and destination (in the case of a two-way data binding). Once you define this class, you can
use it to qualify further the processing of your data-binding operation.</p>
<p>Assuming that you wish to display whole numbers within the Label control, you can build the
following class using Expression Blend. Activate the Project &gt; Add New Item menu and insert a class
named MyDoubleConverter. Next, add the following:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">class</span> MyDoubleConverter : IValueConverter
{
    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> Convert(<span class="kwrd">object</span> value, Type targetType, <span class="kwrd">object</span> parameter,
        System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        <span class="rem">// Convert the double to an int.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">double</span> v = (<span class="kwrd">double</span>)value;
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> (<span class="kwrd">int</span>)v;
    }

    <span class="kwrd">public</span> <span class="kwrd">object</span> ConvertBack(<span class="kwrd">object</span> value, Type targetType, <span class="kwrd">object</span> parameter,
        System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)
    {
        <span class="rem">// You won't worry about "two way" bindings</span>
        <span class="rem">// here, so just return the value.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">return</span> value;
    }
}</pre>
<p>The Convert() method is called when the value is transferred from the source (the ScrollBar) to the
destination (the Text property of the TextBox). You receive many of incoming arguments, but you only
need to manipulate the incoming object for this conversion, which is the value of the current double.
You can use this type to cast the type into an integer and return the new number.</p>
<p>The ConvertBack() method will be called when the value is passed from the destination to the
source (if you have enabled a two-way binding mode). Here, you simply return the value straightaway.
Doing so lets you type a floating-point value into the TextBox (e.g., 99.9) and have it automatically
convert to a whole number value (e.g., 99) when the user tabs off the control. This “free” conversion
happens due to the fact that the Convert() method is called again, after a call to ConvertBack(). If you
were simply to return null from ConvertBack(), your binding would appear to be out of sync because the
text box would still be displaying a floating-point number!</p>
<h2>Establishing Data Bindings in Code</h2>
<p>With this class in place, you are ready to register your custom converter with any control that wishes to
use it. You could accomplish this exclusively in XAML; however, to do so, you would need to define some
custom object resources, which you will not learn how to do until the next chapter. For now, you can
register your data conversion class in code. Begin by cleaning up the current definition of the &lt;Label&gt;
control in your data binding tab, so that it no longer uses the {Binding} markup extension:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">Label</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="labelSBThumb"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="30"</span> <span class="attr">BorderBrush</span><span class="kwrd">="Blue"</span>
    <span class="attr">BorderThickness</span><span class="kwrd">="2"</span> <span class="attr">Content</span> = <span class="kwrd">"0"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>In your window’s constructor, call a new private helper function called SetBindings(). In this
method, add the following code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> SetBindings()
{
    <span class="rem">// Create a Binding object.</span>
    Binding b = <span class="kwrd">new</span> Binding();

    <span class="rem">// Register the converter, source and path.</span>
    b.Converter = <span class="kwrd">new</span> MyDoubleConverter();
    b.Source = <span class="kwrd">this</span>.mySB;
    b.Path = <span class="kwrd">new</span> PropertyPath(<span class="str">"Value"</span>);

    <span class="rem">// Call the SetBinding method on the Label.</span>
    <span class="kwrd">this</span>.labelSBThumb.SetBinding(Label.ContentProperty, b);
}</pre>
<p>The only part of this function that probably looks a bit off is the call to SetBinding(). Notice that the
first parameter calls a static, read-only field of the Label class named ContentProperty.</p>
<p>As you will learn about in Chapter 31, you are specifying what is known as a dependency property.
For the time being, just know that when you set bindings in code, the first argument will nearly always
require you to specify the name of the class that wants the binding (the Label, in this case), followed by a
call to the underlying property with the -Property suffix (again, you’ll learn more about this in Chapter
31). In any case, running the application illustrates that the Label only prints out whole numbers.</p>
<h2>Building the DataGrid Tab</h2>
<p>You have built an interesting example so far using nothing but Expression Blend. For the remainder of
this project, however, you will use Visual Studio 2010, which will give you some firsthand experience
regarding how Blend and Visual Studio can work hand-in-hand. So, save your project and close down
Blend. Next, open the same project in Visual Studio 2010 using the File &gt; Open &gt; Project/Solution...
menu option.</p>
<p>The previous data-binding example illustrated how to configure two (or more) controls to
participate in a data-binding operation. While this is helpful, it is also possible to bind data from XML
files, database data, and in-memory objects. To complete this example, you will design the final tab of
your tab control, so it displays data obtained from the Inventory table of the AutoLot database.</p>
<p>As with the other tabs, you begin by changing the current Grid to a StackPanel. Do this by directly
updating the XAML using Visual Studio. Now define a DataGrid control in your new StackPanel named
gridInventory:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">TabItem</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="tabDataGrid"</span> <span class="attr">Header</span><span class="kwrd">="DataGrid"</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
        <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">DataGrid</span> <span class="attr">x:Name</span><span class="kwrd">="gridInventory"</span> <span class="attr">Height</span><span class="kwrd">="288"</span><span class="kwrd">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">StackPanel</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">TabItem</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Next, reference the AutoLotDAL.dll assembly you created in Chapter 23 (where you used the Entity
Framework), as well as System.Data.Entity.dll. You will use the Entity Framework, so you need to
ensure that your project has the required connection string data in an App.config file. You should
probably begin by copying the App.config file from your AutoLotEDM_GUI project from Chapter 23 into
this project using the Project &gt; Add Existing Item menu option.</p>
<p>Open the code file for your window and add a final helper function called ConfigureGrid();make
sure you call this from your constructor. Assuming that you did import the AutoLotDAL namespace, all
you need to do is add a few lines of code:</p>
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ -->
<pre class="csharpcode">
<span class="kwrd">private</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> ConfigureGrid()
{
    <span class="kwrd">using</span> (AutoLotEntities context = <span class="kwrd">new</span> AutoLotEntities())
    {
        <span class="rem">// Build a LINQ query that gets back some data from the Inventory table.</span>
        <span class="kwrd">var</span> dataToShow = <span class="kwrd">from</span> c <span class="kwrd">in</span> context.Inventories
        select <span class="kwrd">new</span> { c.CarID, c.Make, c.Color, c.PetName };
        <span class="kwrd">this</span>.gridInventory.ItemsSource = dataToShow;
    }
}</pre>
<p>Notice that you do not directly bind context.Inventories to the grid’s ItemsSource collection;
instead, you build a LINQ query that appears to ask for the same data in the entities. The reason for this
approach: The Inventory object set also contains additional EF properties that would appear on the grid,
but which don’t map to the physical database.</p>
<p>If we were to run the project as-is, you would see an extremely plain grid. To make the grid a bit less
of an eye sore, use the Visual Studio 2010 Properties window to edit the Rows category of the DataGrid.
At a minimum, set the AlternationCount property to 2 and pick a custom brush using the integrated
editor for the AlternatingRowBackground and RowBackground properties (see Figure 28-47 for some
possible values).</p>
<img src="http://www.diggen.co.uk/Images/Figure28_47.png" alt="Figure 28-47" />
<p><b>Figure 28-47</b> Applying some eye candy to the grid</p>
<p>You can see the final tab for this example in Figure 28-48.</p>

<p><b>Figure 28-48</b> The final tab of your project</p>
<p>To be sure, you can configure the WPF DataGrid in a huge number of ways, so you’ll want to consult
the .NET Framework 4.0 SDK for details. For example, you can build custom data templates for the
DataGrid using WPF graphical types; this enables you to provide an extremely rich UI.</p>
<p>That wraps up the current example. You’ll use some other controls in later chapters; at this point,
however, you should feel comfortable with the process of building UIs with Blend, Visual Studio 2010,
and manually using XAML and C# code.</p>
