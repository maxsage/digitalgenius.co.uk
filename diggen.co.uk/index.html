    <h1>Welcome to diggen.co.uk</h1>
    <p>The visual studio solution has now been moved to GitHub. I keep all the HTML and image files on this site related to the Digital Genius quiz program. The Additional Info sections 
    use these HTML files to display Additional Info about each topic. I used to store this data in the database but, although it 
    is still there as well, I am trying to point to this website instead</p>
